# TRIPOD

### TuRnIng POint Dataset 

This repository contains the screenplays and plot synopses with turning points (TPs) annotations for 99 movies. Each movie contains:

1. The Wikipedia [1] plot synopsis (extended summary of 35 sentences on average) with sentence-level TP annotations.
2. The screenplay (all dialogue and description parts of the movie) segmented into scenes (selected from the Scriptbase dataset [2]).
4. The cast information (according to IMDb page [3]).

We also split the dataset into training and test. For the movies of the test set, we also provide scene-level TP annotations for the corresponding screenplays.

The data will be uploaded soon.
