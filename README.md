## TRIPOD

#### TuRnIng POint Dataset 

This repository contains the screenplays and plot synopses with turning point (TP) annotations for 99 movies. Each movie contains:

1. The [Wikipedia] plot synopsis (extended summary of 35 sentences on average) with sentence-level TP annotations.
2. The screenplay (all dialogue and description parts of the movie) segmented into scenes (selected from the [Scriptbase dataset]).
4. The cast information (according to [IMDb]).

We split the dataset into training and test. For the movies of the test set, we also provide scene-level TP annotations for the corresponding screenplays.

**The data will be uploaded soon.**
