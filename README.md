#TuRnIng POint Dataset 

This repository contains the screenplays and plot synopses with turning points (TPs) annotations for 99 movies. Each movie contains:

1. The Wikipedia plot synopsis (extended summary of 35 sentences on average) with sentence-level TP annotations.
2. The screenplay segmented into scenes (selected from the Scriptbase dataset).
4. The cast information (according to IMDb page).

We also split the dataset into training and test. For the movies of the test set, we also provide scene-level TP annotations for the corresponding screenplays.
