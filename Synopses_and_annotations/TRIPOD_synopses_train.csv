Beloved (film)_1,"Set shortly after the Civil War, the film revolves around Sethe, a former slave living on the outskirts of Cincinnati.
When the film begins, an angry poltergeist terrorizes Sethe and her three children, causing her two sons to run away forever.
Eight years later, Sethe (Oprah Winfrey) lives alone with her daughter, Denver (Kimberly Elise).
Paul D (Danny Glover), an old friend from Sweet Home, the plantation Sethe had escaped from years earlier, finds Sethe's home, where he drives off the angry spirit.
Afterwards, Paul D. proposes that he should stay and Sethe responds favorably.
Shortly after Paul D. moves in, a clean young woman (Thandie Newton) named Beloved stumbles into Sethe's yard and also stays with them.

Denver is initially happy to have Beloved around, but learns that she is Sethe's reincarnated daughter.
Nonetheless, she chooses not to divulge Beloved's origins to Sethe.
One night, Beloved, aware that Paul D. dislikes her, immobilizes him with a spell and proceeds to assault him sexually.
Paul D. resolves to tell Sethe what happened, but instead tells what has happened to a co-worker, Stamp Paid (Albert Hall).
Stamp Paid, who has known Sethe for many years, pulls a newspaper clipping featuring Sethe and tells her story to the illiterate Paul D.

Years ago, Sethe was raped by the nephews of Schoolteacher, the owner of Sweet Home.
She complained to Mrs. Garner, Schoolteacher's sister-in-law, who confronted him.
In retaliation, Schoolteacher and his nephews whip Sethe.
Heavily pregnant with her fourth child, Sethe planned to escape.
Her other children were sent off earlier to live with Baby Suggs, Sethe's mother-in-law, but Sethe stayed behind to look for her husband, Halle.
Sethe was assaulted while searching for him in the barn.
The Schoolteacher's nephews held her down, raped her and forcibly took her breast milk.

When Halle failed to comply, Sethe ran off alone.
She crossed paths with Amy Denver, a white girl who treated Sethe's injuries and delivered Sethe's child, whom Sethe named Denver after Amy.
Sethe eventually reached Baby Sugg's home, but her initial happiness was short-lived when Schoolteacher came to claim Sethe and her children.
In desperation, Sethe cuts her older daughter's neck and tried to kill her other children.
Stamp Paid managed to stop her and the disgusted Schoolteacher leaves them alone.

Paul D., horrified by the revelation and suddenly understanding the origin of the poltergeist, confronts Sethe.
Sethe justifies her decision without apology, claiming that her children would be better off dead than enslaved.
Paul D. departs shortly thereafter in protest.
After Paul D.'s departure, Sethe realizes that Beloved is the reincarnation of her dead daughter.
Feeling elated yet guilt, Sethe spoils Beloved with elaborate gifts while neglecting Denver.
Beloved soon throws a destructive tantrum and her malevolent presence causes living conditions in the house to deteriorate.
The women live in squalor and Sethe is unable to work.
Denver becomes depressed yet, inspired by a memory of her grandmother's confidence in her, she eventually musters the courage to leave the house and seek employment.

After Denver attains employment, women from the local church visit Sethe's house at the request of her new co-worker to perform an exorcism.
The women from the church comfort the family, and they are praying and singing loudly when Denver's new employer arrives to pick her up for work.
Sethe sees him and, reminded of Schoolteacher's arrival, tries to attack him with an icepick, but is subdued by Denver and the women.
During the commotion, Beloved disappears completely and Sethe, freed from Beloved's grip, becomes permanently bedridden.

Some months later, Paul D. encounters Denver at the marketplace.
He notices she has transformed into a confident and mature young woman.
When Paul D. later arrives at Sethe's house, he finds her suffering from a deep malaise.
He assures Sethe that he and Denver will now take care of her.
Sethe tells him that she doesn't see the point, as Beloved, her ""best thing"", is gone.
Paul D disagrees, telling Sethe that she herself is her own best thing.","[STR_SENT] Set shortly after the Civil War, the film revolves around Sethe, a former slave living on the outskirts of Cincinnati.

Jaws (film)_0,"A girl named Chrissie Watkins leaves a beach party at dusk on Amity Island and goes skinny dipping.
While swimming out near a buoy, she is seized by something from below; it thrashes her around and drags her down.

Chrissie is reported missing and her remains are later found on the beach by the Deputy of police chief Martin Brody.
The medical examiner informs Brody that she was killed by a shark.
Brody plans to close the beaches but is overruled by mayor Larry Vaughn, who fears that reports of a shark attack will ruin the summer tourist season, the town's primary source of income.
The medical examiner consequently attributes the death to a boating accident.
Brody reluctantly goes along with the explanation.
The shark then kills a young boy swimming at the beach.
His mother places a bounty on the shark, sparking an amateur shark-hunting frenzy and attracting the attention of local professional shark hunter Quint, who offers to kill the shark for $10,000.
Marine biologist Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains and determines that she was killed by a shark, not a boat.

A large tiger shark is caught by fishermen, leading the townspeople to believe the problem is solved.
Hooper asks to examine its stomach contents, but Vaughn refuses.
That evening, Brody and Hooper secretly open the shark's stomach and discover that it does not contain human remains.
They head out to sea to find the shark, but instead find the wreckage of a boat belonging to local fisherman Ben Gardner.
Hooper explores the vessel underwater and discovers a sizable shark's tooth protruding from the damaged hull before he is startled by Gardner's corpse, causing him to drop the tooth.
Without evidence, Vaughn refuses to close the beaches.

Many tourists arrive on the Fourth of July.
A children's prank causes panic at the main beach while the shark enters a nearby estuary and kills a man.
Brody's son Michael, who narrowly escapes the attack, goes into shock.
Brody persuades Vaughn to hire Quint, and Quint reluctantly allows Hooper and Brody to join the hunt.
The three set out to kill the shark aboard Quint's vessel, the Orca.

Brody is given the task of laying a chum line but an enormous great white looms up behind the boat, and the trio watch it circle the Orca.
Quint estimates its size at twenty-five feet in length, with a weight of three tons.
He harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.

The men retire to the cabin, where Quint relates his experience with sharks as a survivor of the sinking of the USS Indianapolis.
The shark returns, damages the hull and slips away.
It reappears in the morning.
Brody attempts to call the U.S. Coast Guard, but Quint destroys the radio.
Quint harpoons two more barrels to the shark, and the men tie them both to the stern, but the shark drags the boat backwards, forcing water onto the deck and flooding the engine.
Quint heads toward shore, hoping to draw it into shallow waters and suffocate it.
In his obsession to kill the shark, Quint burns out the Orca's engine.

With the boat immobilized, the trio attempt a desperate approach: Hooper dons scuba gear and enters the ocean inside a shark proof cage, intending to stab the shark with a hypodermic spear filled with strychnine.
The shark attacks the cage from behind, causing Hooper to drop the spear.
When the shark becomes entangled in the wrecked cage, Hooper escapes and hides in the seabed.
The shark then leaps onto the boat, crushing the transom.
Quint slides down the deck and is eaten by the shark.
When the shark attacks again, Brody shoves a pressurized scuba tank into its mouth, then takes Quint's rifle and climbs the sinking Orca's mast.
The shark, with the tank still in its mouth, begins swimming toward Brody.
Brody shoots the tank, causing it to explode and blowing the shark to pieces.
Hooper resurfaces and he and Brody use the barrels to swim toward shore.","[STR_SENT] A girl named Chrissie Watkins leaves a beach party at dusk on Amity Island and goes skinny dipping.

[END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The medical examiner consequently attributes the death to a boating accident. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Brody reluctantly goes along with the explanation. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The shark then kills a young boy swimming at the beach. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] His mother places a bounty on the shark, sparking an amateur shark-hunting frenzy and attracting the attention of local professional shark hunter Quint, who offers to kill the shark for $10,000. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Marine biologist Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains and determines that she was killed by a shark, not a boat. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] A large tiger shark is caught by fishermen, leading the townspeople to believe the problem is solved. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Hooper asks to examine its stomach contents, but Vaughn refuses. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] That evening, Brody and Hooper secretly open the shark's stomach and discover that it does not contain human remains. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] They head out to sea to find the shark, but instead find the wreckage of a boat belonging to local fisherman Ben Gardner. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Hooper explores the vessel underwater and discovers a sizable shark's tooth protruding from the damaged hull before he is startled by Gardner's corpse, causing him to drop the tooth. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Without evidence, Vaughn refuses to close the beaches. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Many tourists arrive on the Fourth of July. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] A children's prank causes panic at the main beach while the shark enters a nearby estuary and kills a man. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Brody's son Michael, who narrowly escapes the attack, goes into shock. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Brody persuades Vaughn to hire Quint, and Quint reluctantly allows Hooper and Brody to join the hunt. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The three set out to kill the shark aboard Quint's vessel, the Orca. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Brody is given the task of laying a chum line but an enormous great white looms up behind the boat, and the trio watch it circle the Orca. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Quint estimates its size at twenty-five feet in length, with a weight of three tons. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] He harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The men retire to the cabin, where Quint relates his experience with sharks as a survivor of the sinking of the USS Indianapolis. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The shark returns, damages the hull and slips away. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] It reappears in the morning. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Brody attempts to call the U.S. Coast Guard, but Quint destroys the radio. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Quint harpoons two more barrels to the shark, and the men tie them both to the stern, but the shark drags the boat backwards, forcing water onto the deck and flooding the engine. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Quint heads toward shore, hoping to draw it into shallow waters and suffocate it. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] In his obsession to kill the shark, Quint burns out the Orca's engine. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] With the boat immobilized, the trio attempt a desperate approach: Hooper dons scuba gear and enters the ocean inside a shark proof cage, intending to stab the shark with a hypodermic spear filled with strychnine. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The shark attacks the cage from behind, causing Hooper to drop the spear. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] When the shark becomes entangled in the wrecked cage, Hooper escapes and hides in the seabed. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The shark then leaps onto the boat, crushing the transom. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Quint slides down the deck and is eaten by the shark. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] When the shark attacks again, Brody shoves a pressurized scuba tank into its mouth, then takes Quint's rifle and climbs the sinking Orca's mast. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The shark, with the tank still in its mouth, begins swimming toward Brody. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Brody shoots the tank, causing it to explode and blowing the shark to pieces. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Hooper resurfaces and he and Brody use the barrels to swim toward shore. [END_SENT] ",1,7,20,30,38
Angel Eyes (film)_1,"On a wet rainy night in Chicago, police officer Sharon Pogue (Jennifer Lopez) is at the scene of a serious traffic accident holding the hand of one of the victims, pleading that he hold on and not give up.
One year later, Sharon is frustrated with the men she dates, and has become estranged from her family for having her father arrested for beating her mother Josephine (Sonia Braga).
Her father and brother, Larry (Jeremy Sisto), have never forgiven her, and her anger is affecting her police work.

A man known only as ""Catch"" (Jim Caviezel) wanders the streets of Chicago in a trance-like state, doing good deeds for strangers and neighbors.
One day he recognizes Sharon at a diner and watches her from across the street, and she notices him watching her.
Just then a car pulls up and blasts the diner with machine gun fire, and Sharon and her partner chase after the criminals.
Sharon catches up with one criminal and in the ensuing struggle, he gets her gun and shoots her twice in the chest.
Seeing that she is protected by her bulletproof vest, he prepares to shoot her in the head, but Catch jumps the man and knocks the gun away, saving her life.
That night, Sharon and Catch meet at a tavern and have a drink.
A grateful Sharon tries to learn more about Catch, but he does not talk about himself.
Sharon invites him to her apartment, and after some awkward moments between the two, they share a kiss.
Catch abruptly stops and leaves the apartment, leaving Sharon confused.

The next evening Sharon finds a dandelion taped to her mailbox with Catch's phone number.
She calls and awkwardly invites him to breakfast at a coffee shop the next morning.
When Sharon wakes up, she has second thoughts and calls Catch to cancel their breakfast date.
Catch is already at the coffee shop and never gets the message.
Upset at being stood up, he goes to Sharon's apartment and criticizes her for not showing up for her ""appointment"", and then storms out.
Sharon follows him to his nearly empty apartment.
Surprised at the living conditions, she demands to know more about him, but Catch refuses to reveal anything about his past.
He only says that he is starting ""from scratch"".

Following the advice of his mother-in-law, Catch calls Sharon and apologizes, and the two continue seeing each other.
They go on a lakeside picnic in a state park and share a romantic swim, after which they make passionate love on the shore.
In the coming days, Catch is there to comfort her after a family confrontation.
His positive influence begins to show in her police work.
One night they go to a blues club, and after the band has played a number, Catch notices a trumpet sitting on the bandstand.
He picks up the trumpet and starts to play a soulful version of the tune ""Nature Boy"".
As they're leaving, the owner approaches him, calling him ""Steve Lambert"", and asking where's he's been.
Catch denies even knowing the man and walks away.

The next day, Sharon investigates the name Steven Lambert in the police files and discovers that he is the man whose hand she held at the site of a traffic accident a year earlier, and that Catch's wife and child died in the accident.
She goes to the house he abandoned after the accident and learns that he was a jazz musician and that the accident occurred on his son's birthday.
Wanting to help Catch heal from his emotional wounds, she tries to talk to him about the accident and takes him to the cemetery to see the graves of his family, but he gets very upset and walks away.
Sharon visits Catch's mother-in-law looking for some way of helping the man she loves, and she encourages patience and tells her that Catch will find his way in his own time.

At her parents' wedding vow renewal ceremony, Sharon tries talking to her father but he tells her that he feels like he doesn't have a daughter.
As Sharon starts to leave, she stops and tells the videographer a wonderful story about her father playing with her and her brother when they were children.
She is deeply moved by this memory.
Her father overhears it and is also emotionally affected, but when Sharon looks at him, he turns away.
Meanwhile, Catch finally goes to the cemetery and talks to his deceased wife and child, explaining how he remembers all the wonderful moments they shared.
As Sharon leaves the reception, she sees Catch waiting by her car.
They embrace and profess their love for each other.
As they prepare to leave, Catch tells her that he'll drive.","[STR_SENT] On a wet rainy night in Chicago, police officer Sharon Pogue (Jennifer Lopez) is at the scene of a serious traffic accident holding the hand of one of the victims, pleading that he hold on and not give up.

Sleepless in Seattle_0,"Sam Baldwin, a Chicago architect, loses his wife Maggie to cancer.
He and his young son Jonah start anew in Seattle, Washington, but Sam continues to grieve.

18 months later, on Christmas Eve 1992, Jonah—who wants his father to find a new wife—calls into a talk radio show.
Jonah persuades Sam to go on the air to talk about how much he misses Maggie.
Hundreds of women from around the country hear the program and, touched by the story, write to Sam.

One of the listeners is Annie Reed, a Baltimore Sun reporter.
She is engaged to Walter but feels there is something missing from their relationship.
After watching the film An Affair to Remember, Annie impulsively writes a letter suggesting that Sam meet her on top of the Empire State Building on Valentine's Day.
She does not intend to mail it, but her friend and editor Becky does it for her and agrees to send Annie to Seattle to ""look into doing a story on those radio shows.""

Sam begins dating a coworker, Victoria, whom Jonah dislikes.
Jonah, a baseball fan, reads Annie's letter and likes that it mentions the Baltimore Orioles, but he fails to convince his father to go to New York to meet Annie.
On the advice of his friend Jessica, Jonah replies to Annie, agreeing to the New York meeting.

While dropping Victoria off at the airport for a flight, Sam sees Annie exiting from her plane and is taken by her, although he has no idea who she is.
Annie watches Sam and Jonah playing on the beach together but mistakes Sam's sister Suzy for his girlfriend.
He recognizes her from the airport and says ""Hello"", but Annie can only respond with another ""hello"" before fleeing.
She decides she is being foolish and goes to New York to meet Walter for Valentine's Day.

With Jessica's help, Jonah flies to New York without his father's permission, and goes to the Empire State Building in search of Annie.
Jonah goes to observation deck and asks every unattached woman if she is Annie.
Sam, distraught, follows Jonah and finds him on the observation deck.
Meanwhile, Annie has seen the skyscraper from the Rainbow Room where she is dining with Walter and confesses her doubts to him.
They amicably end their engagement.
She rushes to the Empire State Building but is told that the observation deck is closed.
Annie convinces the guard to allow her to go to the observation deck (An Affair to Remember is the guard's wife's favorite movie) and arrives just moments after the doors to the down elevator close with Sam and Jonah inside.

In spite of the observation deck being deserted, Annie convinces the elevator operator to let her take a quick look around.
She discovers a backpack that Jonah has left behind.
As she pulls out Jonah's teddy bear from the backpack, Sam and Jonah emerge from the elevator, and the three meet for the first time.
Annie asks Jonah if the teddy bear is his, and he says it is.
""Are you Annie?""
Jonah asks.
She nods yes, and Jonah smiles.
""You're Annie,"" says a stunned Sam.

The Mask (film)_0,"Shy and luckless clerk Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) works at an Edge City bank.
He is tormented by nearly everyone except for his Jack Russell Terrier Milo and his co-worker Charlie Schumaker (Richard Jeni).
Meanwhile, gangster Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene) operates a nightclub called the Coco Bongo while plotting to overthrow his Greek boss Niko (Orestes Matacena).
Tyrell sends his singer girlfriend Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz) into Stanley's bank to record its layout, in preparation to rob the bank.
Stanley is attracted to Tina, and she seems to reciprocate.
After being denied entrance to the Coco Bongo, he finds a mysterious wooden mask near the city's harbor.
Placing it on his face transforms him into a zoot-suited, green-faced, bizarre trickster known as The Mask, who is able to cartoonishly alter himself and his surroundings at will.
The transformed Stanley exacts revenge on some of his tormentors, including the auto mechanics who had ripped him off the night before and his bullying landlord Mrs. Peenman (Nancy Fish).
When a street gang attempts to rob him, he scares them by turning a balloon into a Tommy gun.

The next morning, Stanley encounters Lieutenant Kellaway (Peter Riegert), Detective Doyle (Jim Doughan), and newspaper reporter Peggy Brandt (Amy Yasbeck) investigating The Mask's activity.
Despite being sought by the police, he again becomes The Mask in order to steal money targeted by Tyrell and attend Tina's performance.
At the Coco Bongo, The Mask dances exuberantly with Tina, whom he ends up kissing.
Following a confrontation with Tyrell, The Mask flees, leaving behind a scrap of cloth belonging to himself.
Kellaway suspects that Stanley is behind the bank robbery, but Stanley dissuades him.
Stanley consults an expert on masks named Dr. Arthur Neuman (Ben Stein), who tells him that the object is a depiction of Loki, the Norse god of darkness and mischief.
Still later, Stanley transforms into The Mask again and meets Tina at the local Landfill Park.
He is interrupted by Kellaway and Doyle, who attempt to arrest him.
However The Mask distracts them by tricking a large group of Edge City police officers into joining him in a mass performance of the Desi Arnaz song ""Cuban Pete"".
Stanley flees with Peggy, but he is betrayed to Tyrell for a $50,000 bounty.

Tyrell tries on the mask and becomes a malevolent green-faced being.
Forced to reveal the location of the stolen money, Stanley is kept hostage in one of the mob's cars while Tyrell's henchmen reclaim the money.
Stanley is later handed over to Kellaway and Doyle, along with a green rubber mask, to be detained.
When Tina visits Stanley in his cell, he urges her to flee the city.
Tina thanks Stanley for treating her with respect and tells him that she knew that he was The Mask all along.
She tries to leave the city, but is captured by Orlando and Tyrell.
They take her to a charity ball hosted by Niko and attended by the city's elite, including the city's mayor, Mitchell Tilton (Ivory Ocean).
At the ball, the masked Tyrell kills Niko and prepares to destroy both the club and Tina.
Milo helps Stanley escape from prison, and bringing Kellaway as a cover and hostage, they go to the club to stop Tyrell.
After briefly securing the assistance of Charlie, Stanley is spotted by Orlando and captured.
Tina tricks Tyrell into taking off the mask, which is recovered and donned by Milo, turning the dog into a cartoonish pitbull who defeats Tyrell's men while Stanley fights Tyrell.

After recovering the mask, Stanley uses its abilities to save Tina by swallowing Tyrell's bomb and flushing Tyrell down the drain of the club's ornamental fountain.
The police arrive and arrest Tyrell's remaining henchmen, while Kellaway and Doyle try to arrest Stanley again claiming his real identity as The Mask.
Mayor Tilton arrives and debunks Kellaway's claims by announcing that Tyrell was The Mask the whole time because he was one of the victims that was taken hostage by the thug at Coco Bongo.
He tells Stanley that he is a hero, thanks him for saving lives, and orders the police to release him.
In a desperate attempt to prove Stanley was The Mask, Kellaway and Doyle try to claim off Milo for assisting in his escape, but Tilton is not in the mood for their antics.
He goes on to say that he will need to meet with both men in his office the next morning to discuss their early retirement.
All charges against Stanley are dropped, while Kellaway and Doyle must face Tipton's judgment.

The next day, as the sun rise, Stanley, Tina, Milo, and Charlie take the mask back down to the harbor.
Tina throws the mask into the water, and she and Stanley celebrate their victory with a kiss.
Charlie tries to retrieve the mask for himself, only to find Milo swimming away with it.","[STR_SENT] Shy and luckless clerk Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) works at an Edge City bank.

10 Things I Hate About You_0,"Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a new student at Padua High School, is given a tour of the school by Michael Eckman (David Krumholtz), an A.V.
geek.
During the tour, Cameron notices the beautiful and popular Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) and he is immediately smitten with her.
Michael warns Cameron that Bianca is shallow and conceited, and that her domineering father does not allow her to date.
However, Michael does inform Cameron that Bianca is looking for a French tutor.

At the Stratford residence, Bianca's outcast older sister, Kat (Julia Stiles), is in conflict with their overbearing father (Larry Miller), who wants Kat to attend college nearby despite her acceptance to Sarah Lawrence College.
Bianca is also fighting with their father regarding his strict no dating rule.
Kat's aversion to dating prompts their father to come up with a new rule, to Bianca's fury: Bianca can only date if Kat is also in a relationship.
Cameron starts tutoring Bianca (despite knowing little French himself).
After Cameron makes a failed attempt to ask her out on a date, she informs him of her father’s rule.
This motivates Cameron and Michael to find a boy who is willing to date Kat.

Cameron suggests Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger), another outcast who is just as ill-tempered as Kat.
Cameron tries asking Patrick for his assistance, but Patrick scares him off.
Michael suggests that Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan), an affluent student and model who also wants to date Bianca, pay Patrick to take Kat out.
Patrick agrees, but Kat wants nothing to do with him.
After a little effort, Patrick gets Kat to attend a party with him.

At the party, Bianca sees Cameron but is dragged away by Joey.
He poses and tries to please her when Bianca realizes he is just obsessed with himself.
Kat starts table dancing after getting drunk and hits her head on the chandelier, collapsing off the table and into the arms of Patrick who takes her outside.
They talk on the swingset; however after throwing up on his shoes, Patrick takes Kat home.
She unsuccessfully attempts to kiss him after he drives her home, then slams the car door in his face and storms off.
Cameron admits his feelings for Bianca, and they kiss in the front seat of his car.
The next day, Patrick attempts at apologising because he realises he is starting to like Kat but fails, but eventually wins Kat over with a performance of ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" in front of her entire soccer team.
After sneaking Patrick out of detention, the two go paintballing and fall into a haystack, where he kisses her; however, when Patrick later asks Kat to prom, she becomes suspicious and the two fight.

Bianca tries to convince her father to let her attend the prom, but he refuses because Kat is not going to the prom.
When Bianca confronts Kat, it is revealed that Kat previously dated Joey and they slept together once since ""everyone was doing it.""
She tells Bianca that her feelings of isolation from her fellow students dated from that incident and that she would never again do anything just because it was the popular thing to do.

Bianca and Kat end up going to the prom with Cameron and Patrick, respectively.
Joey is furious to learn that Bianca has gone to the prom with Cameron, and confronts Patrick about the ""arrangement"" in front of Kat.
Kat is very angry at Patrick when she discovers the truth and leaves him at the prom.
Joey subsequently confronts Cameron about manipulating the ""deal"" for himself and knocks him to the floor, but Bianca punches Joey numerous times for using her, for hurting Kat's feelings, and for punching Cameron.
Bianca and Cameron share another kiss and leave Joey lying on the floor in pain.

The next morning, Kat and Bianca's relationship appears to have improved drastically as Bianca attempts to comfort her older sister.
Their father allows Kat to go to Sarah Lawrence College, she is extremely grateful and hugs him with happiness.
Later at school, Kat reads a poem which she wrote for English class, titled ""Ten Things I Hate About You,"" revealing her true feelings for Patrick.
After school, Kat finds a guitar in her car for the band she told Patrick that she wanted to start, that Patrick bought her with the money that Joey paid him.
He admits the truth and says that Joey paid him to take out a ""really great girl"", but he messed up because he fell for her.

Men in Black (film)_0,"Men in Black (M.I.B.)
is a secret non-government agency that polices extraterrestrial alien refugees that are residing on Earth and are disguised as humans, created in 1961 after the first contact.
The agency operates from an underground base at a Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority ventilation station in Battery Park.
MIB members use neuralyzers on witnesses' memories of alien sightings, therefore the secrecy of the presence of aliens and the MIB itself is extremely secretive.
MIB is monitoring about 1500 aliens around the world, most of them in the vicinity of New York City.

One night, Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) and his partner, D (Richard Hamilton) intercept a truck containing illegal immigrants, and allow everyone to cross into America except for an extraterrestrial, who is disguised as a human because he is an intergalactical fugitive.
When a suspicious United States Border Patrol agent, who saw K and D pose as fellow Border Patrol agents, sees the alien without its disguise, the alien attacks him, forcing K to destroy it and use the neuralyzer on the agent and his colleagues, claiming that the alien remains splattered all over them are from when the agent shot an underground gas main with his gun.
D, feeling too old, asks K to use the neuralyzer on him.

Meanwhile, James Darrell Edwards III (Will Smith) is a New York police officer pursuing a man on foot while his out-of-shape colleagues can't catch up.
While chasing the incredibly fast and agile fugitive, he corners him and the man throws an odd looking gun away, which disintegrates, and escapes.
When Edwards corners the man again at the top of the (Guggenheim Museum), he sees the man blink with a set of secondary eyelids before jumping over the roof and killing himself.
K arrives at the precinct station, (where no one believes Edwards's incredible story), questions Edwards about the incident, then takes him to a pawnshop run by a man named Jack Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub), an MIB informant who Edwards knew for dealing stolen goods, to identify the strange weapon the criminal drew on him.

While questioning Jeebs, K reveals Jeebs is an alien by blowing his head off with a weapon, which grows back immediately.
After Edwards finds a weapon identical to the one he saw among Jeebs' hidden stash of alien technology, K realizes that the gun was meant to be used in an assassination, but Jeebs is unable to provide any further information.
K uses the neuralyzer on Edwards, takes him to dinner, and leaves him an MIB business card.
Later, Edwards goes to the MIB's secret headquarters and competes with several others to qualify to join the agency.
During one part of the test, a written exam, the candidates struggle to complete the test due to the oddly shaped chairs, until Edwards pulls a table over for him to use.
at another part involving a shooting gallery, Edwards refuses to shoot several aliens because he thinks that they are doing normal everyday things, but shoots a little girl for carrying suspicious quantum physics textbooks.
After the tests, K takes him aside (while Zed uses the neuralyzer on the others for failing the tests) and offers him the position.
Edwards accepts and his identity is erased, becoming Agent J, and explains the nature of MIB and tells him that he will have to distance himself from any human contact to maintain secrecy, and that he will get his own neuralyzer when he learns.

Suspicious of why extraterrestrials are suddenly leaving the planet, the M.I.B.
investigate a farmer named Edgar (Vincent D'Onofrio), who has been acting strangely after an alien craft crashed on his farm and destroying his truck.
Edgar has been killed and his skin used as a disguise by a ""Bug"", a member of a giant cockroach-like species that are at war with several other alien races, including the Arquillians and the humans.
An Arquillian prince hiding in Brooklyn who is disguised as a human jewelry store owner is attacked by the ""bug"" and appears to die along with his friend.
The body is taken to the city morgue and investigated by Dr. Laurel Weaver (Linda Fiorentino).
During the investigation K and J arrive at the morgue posing as Doctors.
The head of the dead Arquillian ""opens"" while being examined by Dr Weaver and J reavealing the actual Arquillian prince.
While dying the Arquillian tells J that ""the galaxy is on Orion's belt"".

M.I.B.
informant Frank the Pug (Tim Blaney), a Remoonian disguised as a small lapdog, explains that the missing galaxy is a massive source of energy housed in a small jewel.
The Bug figures out the galaxy is hanging on the collar of Rosenberg's cat Orion, which refuses to leave the prince's body at the morgue.
Orion has been taken care of by Dr. Laurel Weaver (Linda Fiorentino).
J arrives at the morgue just as the Bug kidnaps Weaver and grabs the galaxy.
The Arquillians deliver an ultimatum to M.I.B.
to secure the galaxy within an hour, or they will destroy Earth.

The Bug arrives at the site of two disguised flying saucers, the observation towers of the New York State Pavilion at Flushing Meadows.
K and J are close behind and destroy one saucer, causing it to crash through the Unisphere.
The Bug sheds Edgar's skin and swallows J's and K's guns.
K tells J to stop the Bug from getting onto the other ship, then taunts the Bug until K too is swallowed.
J infuriates the Bug by crushing cockroaches and taunting him.

The Bug is blown open from the inside by K, who located his weapon in the Bug's stomach.
As J and K sit on the ground covered in slime, the mortally wounded insect tries to attack again, but is killed by Weaver using J's weapon.
The three return to M.I.B.
headquarters and K tells J that he has not been training him as a partner, but rather as a replacement, as he is tired of a life as an agent.
J reluctantly uses the neuralyzer on K, using a story that he has been suffering in a coma for 35 years to allow him to return to his civilian life and the young woman he left behind.
A few days later, it is revealed that Weaver also joined M.I.B.
and is now J's new partner, Agent L.

As a coda, the camera rapidly pulls back, showing that Earth and the Milky Way galaxy are also inside an alien marble being used in a cosmic game, revealing that, like the galaxy in a necklace, we are tiny.","[STR_SENT] Men in Black (M.I.B.) is a secret non-government agency that polices extraterrestrial alien refugees that are residing on Earth and are disguised as humans, created in 1961 after the first contact.

Reservoir Dogs_1,"Eight men eat breakfast at a Los Angeles diner before their planned diamond heist, and none of them knows who they really are.
Six of them use aliases: Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Brown, Mr. Orange, Mr.
Pink, and Mr. White.
With them are gangster Joe Cabot, the organizer of the heist and his son, ""Nice Guy Eddie"".
After they discuss the plan, they leave to the heist.

The action abruptly cuts to a speeding car, in which Mr. White comforts Mr. Orange, who has been shot in the abdomen and is bleeding profusely, revealing they just performed the heist.
Shortly after they reach an abandoned warehouse.
Mr.
Pink arrives and angrily suggests that the job was a setup due to the rapid police response.
Mr. White tells Mr.
Pink that Mr. Brown was killed during the heist, and the men discuss Mr. Blonde, who murdered several civilians after the alarm triggered.
Mr. White is angered that Joe, an old friend of his, employed such a ""psychopath"" and agrees about a possible setup while Mr.
Pink reveals that he escaped with the diamonds and hid them in a secure location.
They argue over whether to take the now unconscious Mr. Orange to a hospital.
Mr. White also reveals that he has told Mr. Orange his name and home town.

Mr. Blonde, having watched them from a distance, steps forward and ends the dispute regarding Mr. Orange.
Mr. White berates him for his deadly rampage, but Mr. Blonde dismisses the criticism.
He tells the others to wait as Eddie is on his way there.
Mr. Blonde has also taken a police officer, Marvin Nash, hostage and the three men beat Nash in an attempt to find out if there is an informant.
Eddie then arrives and orders Mr.
Pink and Mr. White to assist him in retrieving the stolen diamonds and dispose of the hijacked vehicles, while Mr. Blonde stays with Nash and the unconscious Mr. Orange.

Alone with Mr. Blonde, Nash denies any knowledge of a setup, but Mr. Blonde is uninterested and tortures Nash for his own amusement, slashing Nash's face with a straight razor and severing his right ear.
He then douses Nash with gasoline, but before he can ignite it, Mr. Orange shoots and kills Mr. Blonde.
Mr. Orange then reveals to Nash he is an undercover cop, reassuring Nash that, upon Joe's arrival, a large police force is in position to raid the warehouse.

Eddie, Mr.
Pink, and Mr. White return to the warehouse to find Mr. Blonde dead.
Mr. Orange claims that Mr. Blonde was going to kill all of them and take the diamonds for himself.
After impulsively pulling out his gun and killing Nash, Eddie rejects Mr. Orange’s claims, saying that Mr. Blonde was a close personal friend who had always remained loyal to his father.
Then Joe arrives and reveals that Mr. Blue is dead.
He confidently accuses Mr. Orange of being an informant, forcing Mr. White to defend his friend.

Joe, about to execute Mr. Orange, is stopped when Mr. White points his gun at him, and Eddie in-turn takes aim on Mr. White.
Joe eventually shoots Mr. Orange, wounding him again; Mr. White shoots and kills Joe in response; Eddie shoots Mr. White, wounding him; and Mr. White shoots and kills Eddie.

Mr.
Pink, who was hiding during the melee, takes the diamonds and flees.
Badly wounded, Mr. White crawls to Mr. Orange and cradles him in his arms.
However, Mr. Orange reveals that he is in fact an undercover cop.
Devastated, Mr. White points his gun at Mr. Orange's head.
The police storm the warehouse, demanding that Mr. White drop his gun.

At First Sight_0,"Amy Benic (Mira Sorvino) takes a break from working as an architect at a spa in Pinecrest, a small town outside New York City.
Virgil Adamson (Val Kilmer) is a masseur at the spa and gives Amy a massage.
Amy breaks down and cries, later falling asleep as Virgil leaves the room.
When she wakes up, she runs after him to compliment the massage, only to realize that Virgil is blind.
Virgil asks her out, and the two eventually fall in love and begin a relationship.

Virgil lives alone, though his over-protective sister, Jennie (Kelly McGillis), who lives next door, takes care of him.
During an intimate session with Amy, Virgil reveals that he went blind when he was three and that the last thing he saw was something fluffy.
Amy describes the horizon to Virgil as something that you ""can see but can never reach.""

While researching Virgil's condition, Amy learns of Doctor Charles Aaron, a specialist in eye treatment who suggests to Virgil that, with surgery, he could restore his sight.
Virgil refuses.
To understand Virgil's reaction, Amy seeks out Jennie, who reveals that their father left the family years ago after putting Virgil through several kinds of treatment in an unsuccessful attempt to restore his sight.

After waking up with Amy one morning, Virgil decides he will give the operation a try.
It is a success, but after Virgil regains sight for the first time, he becomes confused and disoriented, unable to perceive light and distance.
Dr. Aaron suggests that he should visit Phil Webster (Nathan Lane), a visual physiotherapist.
Webster in turn suggests that Virgil needs to learn everything from scratch himself, through experience.

Virgil and Amy begin living in New York City, with Virgil finding his feet with his new-found sight.
The pair begin drifting apart, as Virgil finds it hard to decipher the look on Amy's face at times.
Amy finds herself constantly having to explain basic things to Virgil.
While at a party, Virgil sees Amy kiss her ex-husband for his birthday.
While trying to leave the party, Virgil walks into a glass pane due to his poor perception.

Virgil's father sees him on television and arranges a reunion; Virgil goes to his father's workplace, but decides at the last minute that he cannot face him yet.

On one of the regular consultation visits with Webster, he brings Virgil to a strip club.
They engage in a deep conversation, where Webster notes that instead of just ""seeing"", Virgil should instead ""look""; there are a lot of things that sight alone cannot solve.
Virgil confesses that he and Amy are drifting apart, but insists that Amy is the most important thing in his life.

Upon returning from a work trip to Atlanta, where she and her ex-husband shared a sensual moment, Amy decides to save the relationship.
She finds Virgil in a park looking for ""the horizon"" in the city.

Virgil's sight begins deteriorating.
He begins experiencing vision blackouts.
After consulting with Dr. Aaron, Virgil realizes that he is losing his sight.
He decides to look for his father.
Virgil reveals to him that he is going blind again, and asks him why he left.
His father tells him that he felt he was a failure when he did not find a way to help his son regain sight.
Virgil states that he should not have left because his mother and sister suffered greatly after his father walked away.

Virgil looks for Amy, who tells him about her plans to travel with him to places like Egypt and Europe.
Withholding the fact that he is again going blind, Virgil tells her there is one thing he really wants to see, and brings her to a ""New York Rangers"" game.

At the game, Virgil realizes that the ""fluffy cloud"" he last remembers seeing was cotton candy.
As he buys some, he suffers a lengthened vision blackout and admits to Amy that he is going blind, which Amy refuses to accept.
Back home, Virgil and Amy argue.
He asks if she wants to spend her life with him if he is going to be blind forever.
Amy hesitates, and Virgil decides to return home.

Virgil is welcomed by Jennie and eases back into his old way of life.
While losing his sight, Virgil spends his remaining time with sight to look at as many things as possible, going through magazines and pictorial books in the library.
He stays up to watch the sunset, seeing the horizon for the first and last time.

After he has been blind again for some time, Virgil is at a park with a guide dog.
He takes a seat, finishes a sandwich, and tosses the wrapping into a bin.
Amy has found him and says, ""You missed.""
Virgil takes a moment then realizes it is Amy.
She sits down and they reconnect; then she reveals that she finished a significant sculpture that he broke during their argument.
Amy apologizes to Virgil for trying to change him and for moving too fast, which led to their problems together.
Virgil puts his hands on Amy's face and touches her tenderly.
She asks if he wants to take a walk and ""see what they see"".
They leave the park together.","[STR_SENT] Amy Benic (Mira Sorvino) takes a break from working as an architect at a spa in Pinecrest, a small town outside New York City.

15 Minutes_0,"After getting out of prison, ex-convicts Emil Slovak (Karel Roden) and Oleg Razgul (Oleg Taktarov) travel to New York City to meet a contact in order to claim their part of a bank heist in Russia (or somewhere in the Czech Republic).
Within minutes of arriving, Oleg steals a video camera.
They go to the brownstone apartment of their old partner Milos Karlova (Vladimir Mashkov) and his wife Tamina, and demand their share.
When Milos admits that he spent it, an enraged Emil kills him with a kitchen knife, then breaks Tamina's neck as Oleg tapes it with his new camera.
The couple's neighbor, Daphne Handlova (Vera Farmiga), witnesses everything, but she escapes before they can get to her.
To cover up the crime, they douse the bodies in acetone, carefully position them on the bed, and burn down the apartment, intending to pass it off as an accident.

Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns), an arson investigator, and NYPD detective Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro) are called to the scene.
Flemming is a high profile detective who frequently appears on the local tabloid TV show Top Story.
Flemming and Warsaw decide to work the case together.
They eventually determine that Milos was stabbed so hard that the knife's tip broke off and lodged in his spine.
While checking out the crowd outside, Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his attention.
When he finally gets to where she was, she is gone, but Warsaw manages to produce a sketch of the witness.

Emil, who got hold of Daphne's wallet when she fled the apartment earlier, realizes that Daphne is in the country illegally and will be deported if she calls the police.
He contacts an escort service from a business card he found in Daphne's wallet.
He asks for a Czech girl hoping she will arrive.
When Honey, a regular call girl, arrives instead, he stabs and kills her, but not before getting the address of the escort service from her.
Oleg tapes the entire murder.
In fact, he tapes everything he can; a wannabe filmmaker, he aspires to be the next Frank Capra.

Flemming and Warsaw investigate her murder, determine the link to the fire, and also visit the escort service.
Rose Heam (Charlize Theron) runs the service and tells them that the girl they are looking for (Daphne) does not work for her but rather a local hairdresser, and she just told the same thing to a couple other guys that were asking the same questions.
Flemming and Warsaw then rush to the hairdresser but get there just after Emil and Oleg warn the girl not to say anything to anyone.
As Flemming puts Daphne into his squad car, he notices Oleg taping them from across the street.
A foot chase begins, culminating in Flemming's partner getting shot and his wallet stolen.
Emil finds a card with Flemming's name and address in it.
He gets very jealous of Flemming's celebrity status and is convinced that anyone in America can do whatever they want and get away with it.

On the night that Flemming is to propose to his girlfriend Nicolette Karas (Melina Kanakaredes), Oleg and Emil sneak into his house and knocks him unconscious, later taping him to a chair.
While Oleg is recording, Emil explains his plan - he will kill Flemming, then he will sell the tape to Top Story, and when he is arrested, he will plead insanity.
After being committed to an insane asylum he will declare that he is actually sane.
Because of double jeopardy, he will get off, collecting the royalties from his books and movies.
Flemming starts attacking them with his chair (while still taped to it) and almost gets them but Emil stabs him in the abdomen, and putting a pillow on Flemming, killing him.

The entire city is in mourning and Emil calls Robert Hawkins (Kelsey Grammer), the host of Top Story, to tell him he has a tape of the killing and is willing to sell it.
Robert pays him a million dollars for the tape.
Warsaw and the entire police force are furious with Robert and can not believe he would air it, especially since his main reporter is Nicolette.
At the same time, Emil and Oleg try to kill Warsaw and Daphne by booby-trapping Daphne's apartment.
The two narrowly escape the resulting fire.

On the night it is aired Emil and Oleg sit in a Planet Hollywood to watch it with the rest of the public.
As the clip progresses, the customers react with horror at the brutality of it, and a few begin to notice Emil and Oleg are right there with them, Oleg actually smiling at the results of his work, and panic takes place.
Emil explains his betrayal to Oleg and as he about to execute Emil with a gun, Oleg stabs him in the arm.
The police come in and arrest the wounded Emil, while Oleg escapes.
They put Emil in Warsaw's squad car but instead of taking him to the police station, Warsaw takes him to an abandoned warehouse where he is going to kill him.
The police arrive just in time and take Emil away.
Everything goes as planned as Emil is now a celebrity and is pleading insanity.
His lawyer agrees to work for 30% of the royalties Emil will receive for his story.
Meanwhile, Oleg is jealous of the notoriety that Emil is receiving.

While being led away with his lawyer and all the media, Warsaw gets into an argument with the lawyer while the Top Story crew is taping the whole thing.
Oleg gives Hawkins the part of the tape where Emil explains his plan to Flemming, proving he was sane the whole time (Oleg presumably kept this part of the tape on hand as part of an ""insurance policy"").
Hawkins shouts out to Emil and explains to him the evidence he now has.
Emil pushes a policeman down, takes his gun and shoots Oleg.
Emil grabs Flemming's fiancée, who is covering the news story, and threatens to shoot her.
He is finally cornered by the police and Warsaw.
Against orders, Warsaw shoots Emil a dozen times in the chest in order to avenge Eddie's death.
An officer shouts that Oleg is still alive, and Hawkins rushes to him to get footage just as Oleg says the final few words to his movie he is taping just before he dies (with the Statue of Liberty in the background).
Shortly afterward, Hawkins approaches Warsaw and tries to cultivate the same sort of arrangement he had with Flemming, suggesting the power an arrangement would give him.
In response, Warsaw punches out Hawkins and leaves the scene as the police officers smile in approval.","[STR_SENT] After getting out of prison, ex-convicts Emil Slovak (Karel Roden) and Oleg Razgul (Oleg Taktarov) travel to New York City to meet a contact in order to claim their part of a bank heist in Russia (or somewhere in the Czech Republic).

The Shipping News (film)_2,"Quoyle's father tosses him into the water, expecting him to naturally swim. The image of struggling to swim returns to Quoyle's mind in times of crisis.

Quoyle lives a lonely life and works as an inksetter in a small newspaper in Poughkeepsie, New York. He becomes infatuated with a vivacious local woman named Petal, marrying her and having a daughter they name Bunny. Six years later, Petal runs off with a lover and Bunny, only to die soon after in a car accident. Bunny is returned by the police to Quoyle, who tell him that Petal had sold their daughter off for $6,000 to an illegal adoption agency. Only days before Quoyle had received the news that his ailing parents killed one another in a suicide pact. After collecting their ashes, Quoyle's aunt Agnis arrives wishing to pay her respects to her brother. Agnis is moving to the ancestral family home in Newfoundland, which has been abandoned for 44 years. Realizing that Quoyle is at a total loss through grief, she first offers to stay a few more days and help him through the crisis, and then persuades him to move with her.

While struggling to rebuild his life, fix up the derelict house, and care for his daughter, Quoyle meets local resident Wavey Prowse, a widow who has a pre-teen boy with a learning disability. Wavey's son and Quoyle's daughter become friends, while the two adults become friends, and then more. Wavey has dark secrets in her past, but so does the Quoyle family.

To support himself and his daughter, Quoyle takes a job at the local newspaper Gammy Bird as the ""Shipping News"" correspondent, covering shipping traffic in town, as well as local car crashes. With no experience in journalism, Quoyle struggles to produce decent articles and incurs the dislike of the newspaper's second in command, Tert Card. An article Quoyle writes about a millionaire's yacht docked in town, however, becomes a great success with readers, and the newspaper's editor, Jack Buggit, is so impressed that he commissions him to write a series of articles profiling boats and the personal history of their owners.

A storm destroys the Quoyle home, and Jack, caught in the rope of a lobster pot while fishing, is believed drowned. His body is recovered, appears to be dead, but is actually in a deep state of shock resulting from hypothermia. During his wake, at his home in front of mourners, he regains consciousness.

30 Minutes or Less_0,"Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) is a marijuana-smoking, slacker pizza delivery driver who has trouble completing the ""30 Minutes Or Less"" policy that his employer issues, leading to a reprimand from his boss Chris (Brett Gelman).
Nick's school teacher friend Chet (Aziz Ansari) discovers that Nick has slept with and still has feelings for Chet's twin sister Kate (Dilshad Vadsaria).
After a heated argument, Chet storms out, ending their friendship.

Dwayne King (Danny McBride) and Travis Cord (Nick Swardson), are miserable living under the shadow of Dwayne's domineering father the Major (Fred Ward), a multi-million dollar lottery winner.
Dwayne confides in lap-dancer Juicy (Bianca Kajlich) about his contempt for his father and Dwayne's presumed inheritance.
Juicy tells him she knows a hit-man who will kill Dwayne's dad for $100,000.
At Travis's suggestion, he and Dwayne devise a plot to kidnap a complete stranger and strap a remote-controlled bomb to his chest, to compel him to rob a bank for them for the hit money Dwayne needs.
After seeing an advertisement for the pizzeria that Nick works at, they order a pizza and wait for a driver to come to their hideout.
When Nick arrives, Dwayne and Travis (who are wearing a gorilla and monkey mask) assault him and Travis chloroforms Nick.

When Nick wakes up, he finds a vest rigged with explosives strapped and buckled onto his torso, with both a timer and a cellular phone-activated trigger.
Disguised, Dwayne and Travis tell him his situation: if he does not rob a bank within 10 hours, the bomb will detonate.
For effect, Dwayne demonstrate another bomb blowing up a stuffed Teddy bear.
Dwayne states that if Nick dares going to the police, they will remotely detonate the bomb, as they will be monitoring him.
In his panic, Nick goes to a school where Chet is working and desperately pleads with him to help.
After plans to deactivate or remove the bomb are dashed, Chet says he has no choice but to rob the bank.
Still uneasy, Nick asks Chet to assist him.
Chet reluctantly agrees.

En route to the bank, Nick stops by his workplace to tell off his boss and quit, then goes to see Kate and say some potential final words to her.
Nick and Chet hold up the bank and obtain money while the bank manager pulled the alarm, forcing Nick and Chet to flee quickly as Dwayne and Travis, outside, watch the commotion.
A police officer arrives, but when Nick shows him the bomb vest, he runs away.
Nick calls Dwayne and tells him he has the money.
Dwayne says he and Travis will meet him at an abandoned rail-yard to make the exchange.
Dwayne and Travis go to a restaurant instead as Dwayne calls up Juicy to get her hit-man ally and to head to the rail-yard.
When Dwayne asks Travis to be the one to detonate the bomb if the time comes, Travis starts to become unsettled.

Nick waits for Dwayne and Travis at the railyard while Chet hides nearby to avoid disclosing his involvement in the scheme.
Juicy and the hit-man Chango (Michael Peña) arrive to pick up the money.
Nick hands Chango the money and expects Chango to give him the code which will deactivate the bomb.
When Nick keeps asking him for the code, Chango gets aggravated and holds Nick at gunpoint.
Chet appears and strikes Chango with a metal bar while Nick incapacitates Juicy.
The two grab the money and escape.

Dwayne gets a call from Nick who berates Dwayne for not giving Chango the code to the bomb, and dares him to detonate the bomb with the money at his side.
Nick tells Chet that this is a tactic for when the third call is made to them, the details to leave the money and the codes will be made.
Overly frustrated by the turn of events and when Nick doesn't answer the phone again, Dwayne activates the speed dial number on his phone for the bomb to explode, but Travis altered the numbers while Dwayne wasn't looking because he was getting nervous about Dwayne's gradually violent attitude.
When Dwayne thinks that Nick is calling him, it is instead Chango who informs him about what had happened during the exchange.
Chango states that the deal is off and that he'll be coming after Dwayne next.
Rethinking their plan, the two head to Kate's apartment in their masks and kidnap her while she was in the restroom.
Chango breaks into the Major's house to find information regarding Dwayne's location and finds a hand-drawn map to the scrapyard.
While there, the Major attacks him with a pen gun as Chango asks why he is protecting Dwayne if he is the one that called the hit.
The Major is then shot in the stomach by Chango after a struggle.
Upon applying some peroxide, Chango uses the information he found in Dwayne's room to head to the scrapyard.
Dwayne calls Nick to let him know that he has Kate and if he doesn't meet at the scrapyard to give him the money, he will kill her.

Nick arrives at the scrapyard and exchanges the money for Kate.
Dwayne gives Nick the code (which is Dwayne's favorite sexual position: 69 69 69) to deactivate and unbuckle the bomb with just minutes to spare.
Dwayne has them at gunpoint but Nick has Chet fake having a sniper on them by pointing with his laser pointer.
Dwayne and Travis believe him and drop their weapons and leave with the money.
However, Nick is brutally knocked out by Chango who now has Dwayne at gunpoint, demanding for the money.
Dwayne gives him the money but Chango decides to still kill him.
Travis, who has a flamethrower, torches Chango.
While being burned on the ground, Chango shoots Dwayne in the shoulder and shoots the gas tank on Travis's back and it explodes.

Nick takes the money and leaves with Kate and Chet.
Dwayne saves Travis by beating the fire of the exploded gas tank with his shirt.
Dwayne gets in his van to chase after Nick and steal the money and when he has Nick at gunpoint just as his van explodes, seemingly killing him.
Nick reveals he reactivated the bomb and put it in Dwayne's van.
Afterwards the trio talk about what they'll do with their money but it squirts blue dye on Chet's face.

I Am Legend (film)_0,"In October 2009, medical researcher Dr. Alice Krippin (Emma Thompson) created a genetically-engineered variant of the measles virus meant as a cure for cancer.
After a brief period of successful clinical trials, the virus mutated into a lethal strain that killed 5.4 billion people world-wide.
Of those who survived, approximately 558 million devolved into feral and aggressive creatures referred to as ""Darkseekers"", acquiring heightened agility and strength, along with animalistic cunning, but developed acute photosensitivity (exposure to sunlight causes them severe pain, making Darksiders primarily nocturnal hunters) and lost all human capacity for reason or pity, who then proceeded to hunt down and kill the remaining 12 million humans who were immune to both the virus's lethal and mutagenic effects.

In September 2012, military virologist Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the last human in New York City, and potentially the last human on Earth.
During the outbreak, Robert lost his wife Zoe (Salli Richardson) and daughter Marley (Willow Smith) in a helicopter accident during a chaotic quarantine of Manhattan.
Robert's daily routine includes experimenting on infected rats to find a cure for the virus, trying to isolate the gene in his blood that makes him immune, and trips through a decaying Manhattan to collect food and medical supplies or hunt for deer that have wandered into the city from other regions.
Lions and possibly other animals have escaped from the Central Park Zoo and are thriving as wild animals seem unaffected by the virus.
He keeps vigil each day for a response to his recorded AM radio broadcasts, which instruct any survivors to meet him at midday at the South Street Seaport, where he carefully sits on a bench and waits every day for 30 minutes.
Neville's isolation is broken only by the companionship of his pet German Shepard Sam and interaction with mannequins he has set up as patrons of a video store.

He lives in his Washington Square Park townhouse where he settled with his family.
During the outbreak, using knowledge from the Darkseekers' habits, he has shielded it with UV projectors and iron shutters inside the windows.
He has also set up several generators in the house to provide electricity.
He also always returns home before night so the Darkseekers cannot locate his home.
He also has a UV-light mounted pick-up truck with safety bumpers.

One day, he is hunting deer with Sam, who chases a deer to an abandoned dark building.
He finds the deer dead and discovers the dog hiding and realizes the building is full of infected Darkseekers, and then flees with Sam.
To test a treatment, Robert sets a snare trap that uses the scent of blood to capture an infected woman.
As he is inspecting the captured woman, a male Darkseeker briefly emerges from the building, screaming in agony as he exposes himself to sunlight; Neville assumes this is due to increased hunger and notes that the loss of all human characteristics in the Darkseekers is complete.
In his laboratory in the basement, Neville tries the new serum on the infected woman, seemingly without success.

The next day, he finds one of his mannequins moved on to the street in front of Grand Central Terminal.
Robert is unfortunately caught in a snare trap and passes out.
He regains consciousness at dusk and frees himself, but a pack of infected dogs attack Robert and Sam.
During the fight, one of the infected dogs bites Sam.
Domestic animals or animals adapted for a human setting seem to be infected and suffer just like humans as dogs and urban rats can be infected.
Robert brings Sam home and attempts to save the dog by injecting a strain of his serum, but it is too late.
Sam starts to mutate, forcing Robert to strangle her to death.

Overwhelmed by grief and rage, Robert attacks a group of Darkseekers in the Seaport the following night with his third generation Ford Expedition equipped with UV lights, seemingly as a suicidal last stand.
He kills many, but they overwhelm and nearly kill him before he is rescued by a pair of immune humans, a woman named Anna (Alice Braga) and a boy named Ethan (Charlie Tahan), who followed his radio broadcasts from Maryland.
Anna and Ethan take Robert back to his home.
Anna explains that they are making their way to a survivors' camp in Bethel, Vermont.
Robert does not believe such a camp exists and expresses doubt when Anna says God told her about it.

The following night, an alpha male leads an infected mob in an attack on Robert's house.
Anna, who was unaware of Robert's precautions in covering his scent outside the house, had inadvertently allowed the Darkseekers to follow their trail.
As the Darkseekers charge the house, Robert stops the first wave with UV light projectors, which others destroy.
Robert also destroys the second wave with mines planted in the yard, but he finds himself defenseless against the third wave.
As Robert tries to find Anna and Ethan, the alpha male and another Darkseeker enter the house, and the alpha male attacks him.
As Robert fends off the alpha male, the other Darkseeker rushes upstairs and begins tearing a hole in the roof so others can get in.

After Robert saves Anna and Ethan, they retreat into the laboratory.
They seal themselves in a glass-walled room with the infected woman and discover that Neville's treatment is working; the subject looks much more human.
The Darkseekers break in and the alpha male begins to throw himself against the glass, cracking it into the shape of a butterfly.
Robert then sees Anna's butterfly tattoo and thinks of his daughter Marley, who used to make a butterfly shape with her hands (a brief voiceover of Marley mentioning butterflies plays).
Robert then draws a vial of the infected woman's blood and gives it to Anna, before shutting her and Ethan inside a coal chute in the back of the lab.
He then detonates an M67 grenade to destroy the attackers at the cost of his own life.
Anna and Ethan wake up the next morning to find all of the attackers gone and head towards the survivor colony.

Anna and Ethan arrive at the survivors' colony, where Anna hands over the antidote.
Anna later states that the survivors are Robert's legacy, as his fight for a cure became a legend.","[STR_SENT] In October 2009, medical researcher Dr. Alice Krippin (Emma Thompson) created a genetically-engineered variant of the measles virus meant as a cure for cancer.

Top Gun_2,"United States Naval Aviator Lieutenant Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) flies a F-14A Tomcat off USS Enterprise (CVN-65), with Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards) as his Radar Intercept Officer (RIO).
At the start of the film, Maverick and his wingman ""Cougar"" (John Stockwell), intercept (fictional) MiG-28s over the Indian Ocean.
During the standoff, one of the MiGs manages to get a missile lock on Cougar.
Maverick realizes that the MiG is only trying to intimidate Cougar and drives it off, but Cougar is too shaken afterward to land.
Maverick defies orders and shepherds Cougar back to the carrier as both planes run critically low on fuel.
After they land, Cougar retires (""turns in his wings""), stating that he has been holding on ""too tight"" and has lost ""the edge"", almost orphaning his newborn child, whom he has never seen.
Although disapproving of Maverick's reckless flying and repeated violations of rules, the Enterprise's CAG ""Stinger"" (James Tolkan) sends Maverick and Goose—now his top crew—to attend the Navy's Fighter Weapons School, known as ""Top Gun"", at NAS Miramar.

It is revealed that Maverick's recklessness is partly due to his father, Duke Mitchell, who served with the VF-51 squadron aboard the USS Oriskany (CV-34) during the Vietnam War, and was killed in action when his Phantom was shot down.
The official story, which Maverick refuses to believe, is that Duke made a mistake.
Goose is much more cautious and devoted to his wife, Carole (Meg Ryan), and child.
The two officers are nonetheless close friends and effective partners, with Maverick considering Goose as his only family.
At a bar the day before the Top Gun program starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman named Charlotte ""Charlie"" Blackwood (Kelly McGillis), who he later learns is a civilian contractor with a Ph.D. in astrophysics serving as a Top Gun instructor.

Maverick's reckless flying both annoys and impresses Lieutenant Commander Rick ""Jester"" Heatherly (Michael Ironside) and other instructors.
He defeats Jester in exercises, but violates two rules of engagement in the process and is strongly reprimanded by the chief instructor, Commander Mike ""Viper"" Metcalf (Tom Skerritt).
Maverick continues to pursue Charlie and becomes a rival to top student Lieutenant Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky (Val Kilmer)—who considers Maverick's methods dangerous and unsafe.
Although outwardly critical of Maverick's tactics, Charlie eventually admits that she admires his flying but was critical because she was afraid for her credibility.
They begin a romantic relationship.

During one flight, Maverick breaks off from his wingman ""Hollywood"" to go one-on-one with Viper, described as ""the finest fighter pilot in the world"".
Although Maverick matches the older pilot move for move, Viper lasts long enough for Jester—who has defeated Hollywood off-screen—to maneuver around and ""shoot"" Maverick down, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual ability.

Near the end of the program, Maverick and Iceman both chase Jester, the latter attempting to gain a missile lock on the target.
Under intense pressure from Maverick, Iceman breaks off.
Maverick's F-14 flies through the jet wash of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a flameout of both engines, entering a flat spin from which he cannot recover, forcing both Maverick and Goose to eject.
Goose ejects directly into the jettisoned aircraft canopy, which breaks his neck, killing him.

Although the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility, he feels guilty for Goose's death, losing his aggressiveness when flying.
Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers leaving the Navy.
Unsure of his future, he seeks Viper's advice.
Viper reveals that he served with Maverick's father and discloses classified details over his last mission, explaining how Duke stayed in the fight after his Phantom was hit and saved three planes before he died.
Information about the dogfight was classified to avoid revealing that the American planes were not where they should have been.

During the graduation party, Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately report to the Enterprise to deal with a ""crisis situation"", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken communications ship, the SS Layton, that has drifted into hostile waters.
Maverick and Merlin are assigned to one of two F-14s as back-up for those flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind.
In the subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs, Hollywood is shot down but he and his RIO, Wolfman, manage to eject safely.
Maverick is sortied alone due to catapult failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death.
Upon rejoining Iceman, they shoot down four MiGs and force the others to flee, and return to the Enterprise, where the two men, with newfound respect for each other, finally become friends.
Offered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to Top Gun as an instructor, to which Stinger jokingly expresses horror.
Later, he is seen tossing Goose's dogtags into the ocean, suggesting that he is finally free of his guilt over Goose's death.

Sitting alone in a restaurant in downtown San Diego, Maverick hears ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"" playing on the jukebox and recalls meeting Charlie.
She reveals that she is in the bar and the two reunite.","[STR_SENT] United States Naval Aviator Lieutenant Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) flies a F-14A Tomcat off USS Enterprise (CVN-65), with Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards) as his Radar Intercept Officer (RIO).

Drive (2011 film)_0,"The unnamed Driver (Ryan Gosling), who lives in an Echo Park, Los Angeles apartment, works as a mechanic and a part-time movie stuntman.
Managed in both jobs by auto shop owner Shannon (Bryan Cranston), the duo also provide a getaway driver service.
With Shannon organizing jobs, the Driver gives criminals a strict five-minute window to commit crimes and reach his vehicle (lest they be left behind).

Meeting his new neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan), the Driver soon becomes close to her and befriends her young son, Benicio (Kaden Leos).
This is undone, however, when Irene's husband, Standard Gabriel (Oscar Isaac), is released from prison.
Standard, while initially hostile toward the Driver, soon warms to him.
Meanwhile, Shannon persuades Jewish mobsters Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Perlman) to purchase a stock car chassis and to build it for the Driver to race.

Standard, owing protection money from his time in prison, is beat up by Albanian gangster Cook (James Biberi).
Threatening both Standard and his family, Cook demands he rob a pawnshop for $40,000 to pay off the debt.
The Driver, concerned for the safety of Irene and Benicio, steals a Ford Mustang and offers to act as the getaway driver for the pawnshop job.

While waiting for Standard and Blanche (Christina Hendricks) to complete the heist, the Driver sees a Chrysler pull into the lot.
As Blanche returns with a large bag, Standard is shot and killed by the pawnshop owner.
The Driver flees with Blanche and the money, but they are pursued by the Chrysler, which tries to force them off the road; eluding the other vehicle, the Driver hides with Blanche in a motel.
Learning the money actually totals a million dollars, the Driver interrogates Blanche, who admits she and Cook planned to double-cross him and Standard, and that the Chrysler belongs to Cook.
Minutes later, two of Cook's men attack them in the motel room, killing Blanche and injuring the Driver before he manages to kill them both.

The Driver confronts Cook in his strip club, breaking his fingers with a hammer and threatening to kill him; Cook reveals that Nino was behind the heist.
The Driver offers to return Nino's money, but Nino declines and instead sends a hitman (Jeff Wolfe) to the Driver's apartment building.
Entering the apartment elevator with Irene, the Driver encounters the hitman in the elevator.
Spotting the hitman's pistol, the Driver kisses Irene before violently beating the hitman, killing him while Irene watches in horror.

In his pizzeria, Nino explains to Bernie and Cook that the heist money belonged to a crime family and, since anyone tied to the robbery could lead the Mafia to them, they need to kill everyone involved.
Nino further explains that it was his plan all along to steal the money from the crime family, and it was his idea to set up the $40,000 dummy robbery.
Bernie then proceeds to murder Cook, before killing Shannon when he refuses to divulge the whereabouts of the Driver.

The Driver, disguising himself with a mask, follows Nino to the Pacific Coast Highway and T-bones Nino's car onto a beach.
With Nino injured and weakened, the Driver drowns him in the Pacific Ocean.
The Driver, using Nino's phone, arranges to meet Bernie at a Chinese restaurant.
The Driver makes a final phone call to Irene to tell her he is leaving, and says that meeting her and Benicio was the best thing that happened to him.

At the restaurant, Bernie promises Irene's and Benicio's safety in exchange for the money, but he warns that he cannot guarantee the safety of the Driver himself.
Outside the restaurant, the Driver gives Bernie the money, only for Bernie to stab him in the stomach.
The Driver retaliates by fatally stabbing Bernie in the neck; he then departs in his car, leaving the money with Bernie's corpse.
That evening, Irene knocks on the Driver's apartment door to no response; the Driver is then shown driving away into the night.","[STR_SENT] The unnamed Driver (Ryan Gosling), who lives in an Echo Park, Los Angeles apartment, works as a mechanic and a part-time movie stuntman. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Managed in both jobs by auto shop owner Shannon (Bryan Cranston), the duo also provide a getaway driver service. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] With Shannon organizing jobs, the Driver gives criminals a strict five-minute window to commit crimes and reach his vehicle (lest they be left behind). [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Meeting his new neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan), the Driver soon becomes close to her and befriends her young son, Benicio (Kaden Leos). [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] This is undone, however, when Irene's husband, Standard Gabriel (Oscar Isaac), is released from prison. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Standard, while initially hostile toward the Driver, soon warms to him. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Meanwhile, Shannon persuades Jewish mobsters Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Perlman) to purchase a stock car chassis and to build it for the Driver to race. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Standard, owing protection money from his time in prison, is beat up by Albanian gangster Cook (James Biberi). [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Threatening both Standard and his family, Cook demands he rob a pawnshop for $40,000 to pay off the debt. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The Driver, concerned for the safety of Irene and Benicio, steals a Ford Mustang and offers to act as the getaway driver for the pawnshop job. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] While waiting for Standard and Blanche (Christina Hendricks) to complete the heist, the Driver sees a Chrysler pull into the lot. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] As Blanche returns with a large bag, Standard is shot and killed by the pawnshop owner. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The Driver flees with Blanche and the money, but they are pursued by the Chrysler, which tries to force them off the road; eluding the other vehicle, the Driver hides with Blanche in a motel. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Learning the money actually totals a million dollars, the Driver interrogates Blanche, who admits she and Cook planned to double-cross him and Standard, and that the Chrysler belongs to Cook. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Minutes later, two of Cook's men attack them in the motel room, killing Blanche and injuring the Driver before he manages to kill them both. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The Driver confronts Cook in his strip club, breaking his fingers with a hammer and threatening to kill him; Cook reveals that Nino was behind the heist. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The Driver offers to return Nino's money, but Nino declines and instead sends a hitman (Jeff Wolfe) to the Driver's apartment building. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Entering the apartment elevator with Irene, the Driver encounters the hitman in the elevator. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Spotting the hitman's pistol, the Driver kisses Irene before violently beating the hitman, killing him while Irene watches in horror. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] In his pizzeria, Nino explains to Bernie and Cook that the heist money belonged to a crime family and, since anyone tied to the robbery could lead the Mafia to them, they need to kill everyone involved. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Nino further explains that it was his plan all along to steal the money from the crime family, and it was his idea to set up the $40,000 dummy robbery. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Bernie then proceeds to murder Cook, before killing Shannon when he refuses to divulge the whereabouts of the Driver. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The Driver, disguising himself with a mask, follows Nino to the Pacific Coast Highway and T-bones Nino's car onto a beach. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] With Nino injured and weakened, the Driver drowns him in the Pacific Ocean. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The Driver, using Nino's phone, arranges to meet Bernie at a Chinese restaurant. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The Driver makes a final phone call to Irene to tell her he is leaving, and says that meeting her and Benicio was the best thing that happened to him. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] At the restaurant, Bernie promises Irene's and Benicio's safety in exchange for the money, but he warns that he cannot guarantee the safety of the Driver himself. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Outside the restaurant, the Driver gives Bernie the money, only for Bernie to stab him in the stomach. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The Driver retaliates by fatally stabbing Bernie in the neck; he then departs in his car, leaving the money with Bernie's corpse.

One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest (film)_0,"In 1963 Oregon, Randle Patrick ""Mac"" McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a recidivist anti-authoritarian criminal serving a short sentence on a prison farm for statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl, is transferred to a mental institution for evaluation.
Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment.

McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients.
McMurphy finds that they are more fearful of Ratched than they are focused on becoming functional in the outside world.
McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader; his fellow patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, stuttering young man; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Max Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is belligerent and profane; Jim Sefelt (William Duell), who is epileptic; and ""Chief"" Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent American Indian of imposing stature believed to be deaf and mute.

McMurphy's and Ratched's battle of wills escalates rapidly.
When McMurphy's card games win away everyone's cigarettes, Ratched confiscates the cigarettes and rations them out.
McMurphy calls for votes on ward policy changes to challenge her.
He makes a show of betting the other patients he can escape by lifting an old hydrotherapy console—a massive marble plumbing fixture—off the floor and sending it through the window; when he fails to do so, he turns to them and says, ""But I tried goddammit.
At least I did that.""

McMurphy steals a hospital bus, herds his colleagues aboard, stops to pick up Candy (Marya Small), a party girl, and takes the group deep sea fishing on a commandeered boat.
He tells them: ""You're not nuts, you're fishermen!""
and they begin to feel faint stirrings of self-determination.

Soon after, however, McMurphy learns that Ratched and the doctors have the power to keep him committed indefinitely.
Sensing a rising tide of insurrection among the group, Ratched tightens her grip on everyone.
During one of her group therapy sessions, Cheswick's agitation boils over and he, McMurphy and the Chief wind up brawling with the orderlies.
They are sent up to the ""shock shop"" for electroconvulsive therapy.
While McMurphy and the Chief wait their turn, McMurphy offers Chief a piece of gum, and Chief murmurs ""Thank you...Ah, Juicy Fruit.""
McMurphy is delighted to find that Bromden is neither deaf nor mute, and that he stays silent to deflect attention.
After the electroshock therapy, McMurphy shuffles back onto the ward feigning illness, before humorously animating his face and loudly greeting his fellow patients, assuring everyone that the ECT only charged him up all the more and that the next woman to take him on will ""light up like a pinball machine and pay off in silver dollars.""

But the struggle with Ratched is taking its toll, and with his release date no longer a certainty, McMurphy plans an escape.
He phones Candy to bring her friend Rose (Louisa Moritz) and some booze to the hospital late one night.
They enter through a window after McMurphy bribes the night orderly, Mr. Turkle (Scatman Crothers).
McMurphy and Candy invite the patients into the day room for a Christmas party; the group breaks into the drug locker, puts on music, and enjoys a bacchanalian rampage.
At the end of the night, McMurphy and Bromden prepare to climb out the window with the girls.
McMurphy says goodbye to everyone, and invites an emotional Billy to escape with them; he declines, saying he is not yet ready to leave the hospital—though he would like to date Candy in the future.
McMurphy insists Billy have sex with Candy right then and there.
Billy and Candy agree and they retire to a private room.
The effects of the alcohol and pilfered medication take their toll on everyone, including McMurphy and the Chief, whose eyes slowly close in fatigue.

Nurse Ratched arrives the next morning and discovers the scene: the ward completely upended and patients passed out all over the floor.
She orders the attendants to lock the window, clean up, and conduct a head count.
When they find Billy and Candy, the other patients applaud and, buoyed, Billy speaks for the first time without a stutter.
Nurse Ratched then announces that she will tell Billy's mother what he has done.
Billy panics, his stutter returns, and he starts punching himself; locked in the doctor's office, he kills himself.
McMurphy, enraged at Nurse Ratched, chokes her nearly to death until orderly Washington knocks him out.

Some time later, the patients in the ward play cards and gamble for cigarettes as before, only now with Harding dealing and delivering a pale imitation of McMurphy's patter.
Nurse Ratched, still recovering from the neck injury sustained during McMurphy's attack, wears a neck brace and speaks in a thin, reedy voice.
The patients pass a whispered rumor that McMurphy dramatically escaped the hospital rather than being taken ""upstairs.""

Late that night, Chief Bromden sees McMurphy being escorted back to his bed, and initially believes that he has returned so they can escape together, which he is now ready to do since McMurphy has made him feel ""as big as a mountain.""
However, when he looks closely at McMurphy's unresponsive face, he is horrified to see lobotomy scars on his forehead.
Unwilling to allow McMurphy to live in such a state, the Chief smothers McMurphy to death with his pillow.
He then carries out McMurphy's escape plan by lifting the hydrotherapy console off the floor and hurling the massive fixture through a grated window, climbing through and running off into the distance, with Taber waking up just in time to see the Chief escape and cheering as the others awake.","[STR_SENT] In 1963 Oregon, Randle Patrick ""Mac"" McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a recidivist anti-authoritarian criminal serving a short sentence on a prison farm for statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl, is transferred to a mental institution for evaluation.

Angel Eyes (film)_0,"On a wet rainy night in Chicago, police officer Sharon Pogue (Jennifer Lopez) is at the scene of a serious traffic accident holding the hand of one of the victims, pleading that he hold on and not give up.
One year later, Sharon is frustrated with the men she dates, and has become estranged from her family for having her father arrested for beating her mother Josephine (Sonia Braga).
Her father and brother, Larry (Jeremy Sisto), have never forgiven her, and her anger is affecting her police work.

A man known only as ""Catch"" (Jim Caviezel) wanders the streets of Chicago in a trance-like state, doing good deeds for strangers and neighbors.
One day he recognizes Sharon at a diner and watches her from across the street, and she notices him watching her.
Just then a car pulls up and blasts the diner with machine gun fire, and Sharon and her partner chase after the criminals.
Sharon catches up with one criminal and in the ensuing struggle, he gets her gun and shoots her twice in the chest.
Seeing that she is protected by her bulletproof vest, he prepares to shoot her in the head, but Catch jumps the man and knocks the gun away, saving her life.
That night, Sharon and Catch meet at a tavern and have a drink.
A grateful Sharon tries to learn more about Catch, but he does not talk about himself.
Sharon invites him to her apartment, and after some awkward moments between the two, they share a kiss.
Catch abruptly stops and leaves the apartment, leaving Sharon confused.

The next evening Sharon finds a dandelion taped to her mailbox with Catch's phone number.
She calls and awkwardly invites him to breakfast at a coffee shop the next morning.
When Sharon wakes up, she has second thoughts and calls Catch to cancel their breakfast date.
Catch is already at the coffee shop and never gets the message.
Upset at being stood up, he goes to Sharon's apartment and criticizes her for not showing up for her ""appointment"", and then storms out.
Sharon follows him to his nearly empty apartment.
Surprised at the living conditions, she demands to know more about him, but Catch refuses to reveal anything about his past.
He only says that he is starting ""from scratch"".

Following the advice of his mother-in-law, Catch calls Sharon and apologizes, and the two continue seeing each other.
They go on a lakeside picnic in a state park and share a romantic swim, after which they make passionate love on the shore.
In the coming days, Catch is there to comfort her after a family confrontation.
His positive influence begins to show in her police work.
One night they go to a blues club, and after the band has played a number, Catch notices a trumpet sitting on the bandstand.
He picks up the trumpet and starts to play a soulful version of the tune ""Nature Boy"".
As they're leaving, the owner approaches him, calling him ""Steve Lambert"", and asking where's he's been.
Catch denies even knowing the man and walks away.

The next day, Sharon investigates the name Steven Lambert in the police files and discovers that he is the man whose hand she held at the site of a traffic accident a year earlier, and that Catch's wife and child died in the accident.
She goes to the house he abandoned after the accident and learns that he was a jazz musician and that the accident occurred on his son's birthday.
Wanting to help Catch heal from his emotional wounds, she tries to talk to him about the accident and takes him to the cemetery to see the graves of his family, but he gets very upset and walks away.
Sharon visits Catch's mother-in-law looking for some way of helping the man she loves, and she encourages patience and tells her that Catch will find his way in his own time.

At her parents' wedding vow renewal ceremony, Sharon tries talking to her father but he tells her that he feels like he doesn't have a daughter.
As Sharon starts to leave, she stops and tells the videographer a wonderful story about her father playing with her and her brother when they were children.
She is deeply moved by this memory.
Her father overhears it and is also emotionally affected, but when Sharon looks at him, he turns away.
Meanwhile, Catch finally goes to the cemetery and talks to his deceased wife and child, explaining how he remembers all the wonderful moments they shared.
As Sharon leaves the reception, she sees Catch waiting by her car.
They embrace and profess their love for each other.
As they prepare to leave, Catch tells her that he'll drive.","[STR_SENT] On a wet rainy night in Chicago, police officer Sharon Pogue (Jennifer Lopez) is at the scene of a serious traffic accident holding the hand of one of the victims, pleading that he hold on and not give up.

Bamboozled_0,"Pierre Delacroix (whose real name is Peerless Dothan), (Damon Wayans) is an uptight, Harvard University-educated black man, working for a television network known as CNS (for ""Continental Network System"").
At work, he has to endure torment from his boss Thomas Dunwitty (Michael Rapaport), a tactless, boorish white man.
Not only does Dunwitty talk like an urban black man, and use the word ""nigger"" repeatedly in conversations, he also proudly proclaims that he is more black than Delacroix and that he can use nigger since he is married to a black woman and has two mixed- race children.
Dunwitty frequently rejects Delacroix's scripts for television series that portray black people in positive, intelligent scenarios, dismissing them as ""Cosby clones"".

Facing the necessity of either coming up with a hit black-centric show or being fired, Delacroix decides to aim for the latter.
Delacroix would be in violation of his contract if he resigned, but getting fired would release him from it and allow him to seek work at another network.
With help from his personal assistant Sloane Hopkins (Jada Pinkett Smith), Delacroix decides to pitch a minstrel show.
Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show is complete with black actors in blackface, extremely racist jokes and puns, and even offensively stereotyped CGI-animated cartoons that caricature the leading stars of the new show.
Delacroix develops the program believing that the network would reject such over-the-top racism and fire him immediately.
Delacroix and Hopkins decide to recruit two impoverished street performers, Manray (Savion Glover, named after American artist Man Ray) and Womack (Tommy Davidson) -- homeless squatters who regularly perform outside CNS' headquarters building to star in the show.
While Womack is horrified when Delacroix tells him details about the show, Manray willfully agrees to star in the show, seeing it as his big chance to become rich and famous for his tap-dancing skills.

To Delacroix's horror, not only does Dunwitty enthusiastically endorse the show, it also becomes hugely successful.
As soon as the show premieres on television, Manray and Womack end up becoming big stars while Delacroix, contrary to his original stated intent, defends the show as being satirical.
Delacroix quickly embraces the show and his newfound fame; he even wins awards for creating and writing the show, while Hopkins becomes horrified at the racist nightmare she has helped to unleash.
In the meantime, an underground, militant rap group called the Mau Maus (presumably named after Mau Mau), led by Hopkins' older brother Julius (Mos Def), becomes increasingly angry at the content of the show.
Though they had earlier auditioned for the program's live band position and were rejected, the group plan to bring the show down using violence.
Eventually, Womack quits, fed up with the show and Manray's increasing ego.
Manray and Hopkins thus grow closer, which angers Delacroix.
Delacroix tries to break up Manray's relationship with Hopkins by accusing her of sleeping with Manray to further her career.
Delacroix reveals that Hopkins only got her position as his assistant by sleeping with him.
The move backfires and drives Manray and Hopkins even closer.

Hopkins creates a tape of racist footage culled from assorted movies, cartoons, television shows, and newsreels to try to shame Delacroix into stopping production of the show, but he refuses to view the tape.
After an argument with Delacroix over all these differences, as well as realizing he is being exploited, Manray defiantly announces that he will no longer wear blackface.
He appears in front of the studio audience, who are all in blackface, during a TV taping and does his dance number in his regular clothing.
The network executives immediately turn against Manray, and Dunwitty (who is also wearing blackface) personally fires him from the show and throws him out of the studio.

The Mau Maus kidnap Manray, and then announce a plan to publicly execute Manray on a live webcast.
The authorities work feverishly to track down the source of the internet feed, but Manray is nevertheless assassinated while doing his famous tap dancing (as a sort of sacrificial figure at his death).
At his office, Delacroix (now in blackface make-up himself, mourning Manray's death) begins to fantasize the various coon-themed antique collectibles in his office staring him down and coming to life and goes into a rage, destroying many of the racist collectibles.
The police quickly catch The Mau Maus, shooting them down in a hail of bullets.
The camera lingers on their corpses, especially female rapper Smooth Blak's (Charli Baltimore) corpse.
They leave only one survivor, a white member known as ""One-Sixteenth Black"" (MC Serch), who tearfully proclaims that he is ""black"" and demands to die with the rest of his group instead of being arrested.
Furious, Hopkins confronts Delacroix at gunpoint with her brother's revolver and demands that he watch the tape she prepared for him.
Delacroix, after watching the tape, tries to get the gun, but is shot in the stomach.
Hopkins, horrified, flees while proclaiming that it was Delacroix's own fault that he got shot.
Delacroix, after positioning the gun to make the gunshot wound to the stomach appear self-inflicted, watches the tape as he lies dying on the floor.

The film concludes with a long montage of racially insensitive and demeaning clips of black characters from Hollywood films of the first half of the 20th century.
Some of the films used in the sequence are The Birth of a Nation, The Jazz Singer, Gone with the Wind, Babes in Arms, Holiday Inn, Judge Priest, Ub Iwerks' cartoon Little Black Sambo, Walter Lantz's cartoon Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat, the Screen Songs short Jingle Jangle Jungle, the Merrie Melodies short All This and Rabbit Stew, and, from the Hal Roach comedy School's Out, Our Gang kids Allen ""Farina"" Hoskins and Matthew ""Stymie"" Beard.
After the montage, as the cameras point to Delacroix's dead body on the floor, the camera then shows Manray doing his last Mantan sequence on stage.","[STR_SENT] Pierre Delacroix (whose real name is Peerless Dothan), (Damon Wayans) is an uptight, Harvard University-educated black man, working for a television network known as CNS (for ""Continental Network System"").

Meet Joe Black_0,"Billionaire media mogul William ""Bill"" Parrish is considering a merger between his company and another media giant, while also about to celebrate his 65th birthday with an elaborate party being planned by his eldest daughter Allison.
He begins to hear mysterious voices, which he tries with increasing difficulty to ignore.

His youngest daughter Susan, an internal medicine resident, is involved with one of Bill's board members.
She is considering marriage, but her father can tell she's not madly in love.
When she asks for the short version of his impassioned speech, he simply says, ""Stay open.
Who knows?
Lightning could strike!""

Susan meets a vibrant young man at a coffee shop.
She is instantly enamored but fails to even get his name.
Minutes after their encounter (but unbeknownst to her), the man is struck by multiple cars in what appears to be a remarkably serious motor vehicle accident.

Death arrives at Bill's home in the body of the young man, explaining that Bill's impassioned speech has piqued his interest.
Given Bill's ""competence, experience, and wisdom,"" Death says that for as long as Bill will be his guide on Earth, he will not have to die.
Making up a name on the spot, Death is introduced to the family as ""Joe Black.""

Bill's best efforts to navigate the next few days — knowing them now to be his last — fail to keep events from going rapidly out of his control.
Drew is secretly conspiring with a man bidding for Parrish Communications.
He capitalizes on Bill's strange behavior and unexplained reliance on Joe Black to convince the board to vote him out as Chairman, using information given to him inadvertently by Bill's son-in-law, Quince, to push through approval for the merger which Bill had decided to oppose.
Quince is devastated.

At first confused and repulsed by Joe, believing him to be the young man from the coffee shop, Susan eventually falls deeply in love with him.
Joe is now under the influence of human desires and becomes attracted to her as well.
Bill angrily confronts him about his relationship with his daughter, but Death declares his intention to take Susan with him for his own.

As his last birthday arrives, Bill appeals to Joe to recognize the meaning of true love and all it encompasses — especially honesty and sacrifice.
Joe comes to understand that his love for Susan means he must forego his desire to take Susan with him and allow her to live her life.
He also helps Bill regain control of his company, exposing Drew's underhanded business dealings to the board by ""revealing"" himself as an agent of the Internal Revenue Service and threatening to put Drew in jail.

Bill devotes his remaining hours of life to his daughters Allison and Susan at his birthday party.
Joe says his last goodbye to Susan, who senses something of the truth behind his words but is unable or unwilling to vocalize this realization.
A fireworks show in the distance, Joe escorts Bill away while Susan watches.
She is astonished when Joe reappears.
The young man, unaware of what events have transpired from the time of his death until his return, isn't even aware how he got here.
A mystified but pleased Susan seems to have forgotten about her time with Joe since her meeting the man at the coffee shop, and indicates that she already knows about her father's passing.
She asks him, ""What do we do now?""
He replies, ""It will come to us.""","[STR_SENT] Billionaire media mogul William ""Bill"" Parrish is considering a merger between his company and another media giant, while also about to celebrate his 65th birthday with an elaborate party being planned by his eldest daughter Allison.

Bridesmaids (2011 film)_0,"Annie Walker (Kristen Wiig) is a single woman in her late 30s.
Following the failure of her bakery, she lost her boyfriend and her savings, reducing her career to a sales clerk at a jewelry store and forcing her to share an apartment with an obnoxious roommate and his sister.
Her business's failure was so painful that she has given up baking entirely.
She has a no-strings-attached sexual relationship with the self-absorbed Ted (Jon Hamm) but hopes for something more from him.
Her best friend Lillian Donovan (Maya Rudolph) is virtually her only source of happiness.

Lillian becomes engaged and asks Annie to be her maid of honor.
At the engagement party, Annie meets her fellow bridesmaids: Lillian's cynical cousin Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey); idealistic friend Becca (Ellie Kemper); raunchy future sister-in-law Megan (Melissa McCarthy); and Helen Harris III (Rose Byrne), the beautiful but over-the-top wife of Lillian's fiancé's boss.
Helen and Annie, who are both jealous of the other's friendship with Lillian, take an instant, strong, dislike to each other, but Lillian persuades them to spend time together.

Annie takes Lillian and the bridesmaids to a Brazilian steak restaurant for lunch before going to a chic bridal shop.
However, Helen must use her influence to gain access to the shop when Annie neglects to make a reservation.
While trying on gowns, the whole party—with the exception of Helen, who did not eat food at the restaurant—becomes sick from food poisoning, ruining their afternoon.
Later, Annie's suggestion of a bachelorette party at Lillian's parents' lake house is overruled in favor of a trip to Las Vegas planned by Helen.
Worried about her finances and too proud to accept a ticket paid for by Helen, Annie books a ticket in coach while the rest of the party flies first class.
However, the trip is cut short due to an outburst from Annie, who due to her fear of flying had accepted a sedative from Helen.
The scene on board the plane forces an emergency landing in Casper, Wyoming, following which the party takes a bus back home.
Annie apologizes but Lillian tells Annie she wants Helen to take over planning the shower and wedding, as ""she does this sort of thing all the time"" and to take some pressure off Annie's shoulders.

Annie continues to hope for a relationship with Ted, but begins flirting with Officer Nathan Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd), a friendly state patrolman who earlier had let her off without a ticket for broken tail lights.
Nathan encourages her to open a new bakery, but Annie refuses.
Following a night together, the next morning Nathan buys baking supplies with which he suggests Annie make them breakfast.
Offended and overwhelmed, Annie leaves.
Annie is later fired from her job for calling a rude teenage customer ""a little cunt"" and—kicked out of her apartment by her odd British roommate and his sister—moves in with her mother.

Annie travels to Chicago for the bridal shower at Helen's home, which has been transformed into a Paris-themed event.
Helen then upstages Annie's heartfelt, handmade shower gift by giving Lillian a trip to Paris, an idea Annie expressed earlier, which Helen stole.
Enraged that Helen has taken credit for the Parisian theme, Annie throws a temper tantrum.
She is kicked out of the shower and the wedding.
On her way home, Annie is involved in a car accident, but the other driver flees the scene.
Nathan happens to be the attending officer, and he admonishes her for not fixing her tail lights and taking responsibility for her life.
He storms off when Ted arrives to give Annie a ride.
When he asks her to perform oral sex on him on the way home, she breaks off the relationship and walks home.

Throughout the next several days Annie becomes reclusive, refusing to leave her mother's house and watching television obsessively.
After a pep talk from Megan, Annie realizes her errors and tries to make amends with Nathan, but he ignores her.
On the day of the wedding, Helen appears at Annie's doorstep distraught; Lillian has disappeared, and Helen begs for Annie's help in finding her.
Helen and Annie have a reconciliation of sorts, and Helen apologizes to Annie.
The two enlist Nathan to help, and he grudgingly agrees.
The group find Lillian at her own apartment, discovering that she ran from her wedding due to Helen's extravagant planning for the wedding and fear of leaving her life in Milwaukee.
After reconciling, Annie helps Lillian prepare for her wedding.

Annie resumes her place as maid of honor at the wedding.
After the wedding, which Annie agrees with Helen is ""perfect,"" Helen again apologizes to Annie and states her hope that they can be friends in the future.
Realizing that Annie and Nathan were falling in love, Helen had also arranged for him to pick Annie up after the wedding.
Nathan and Annie reconcile and ride away in his patrol car.","[STR_SENT] Annie Walker (Kristen Wiig) is a single woman in her late 30s.

Notting Hill (film)_0,"William ""Will"" Thacker owns an independent book store, The Travel Book Co. in Notting Hill. He is divorced from his wife who left him for a man he claims looked like Harrison Ford. He shares his house with an eccentric, carefree Welshman named Spike and has a small, tight knit group of friends that includes Bella, Max, Bernie, and Tony, and his sister Honey.

Will encounters Hollywood actress Anna Scott when she enters his shop where she buys a few books and gives an autograph to an attempted shoplifter and leaves. They collide in the street shortly after and his drink spills on her clothes where he offers his house nearby for Anna to change her clothes. She impulsively kisses him before she leaves and then asks him not to mention the kiss.

Will calls Anna and she invites him to visit her at the Ritz Hotel, but he is shuffled into a press conference and poses as a reporter. Anna calls him back in and says she has cleared her evening. Will is exhilarated, before remembering that he is expected at his sister Honey's birthday party; Anna surprises him by offering to be his date.

At the house of Will's friends Max and Bella, Anna fits in perfectly as they all share stories. Anna and Will share a private moment in a garden square as they walk back from the birthday party. The next evening they go to a restaurant, where Will overhears a group of patrons making crude remarks about Anna and attempts to defend her, before Anna steps in herself and humiliates them. As they walk back to her hotel, she invites Will up to her room. But when he arrives, she tells him he must leave immediately. Her American movie star boyfriend (who was never mentioned until now) appears. Anna is apologetic and embarrassed, while a stunned Will leaves. Over the next six months, Max and Bella set Will up on a series of blind dates, trying to help him move on, but Will, still hung up on Anna, does not connect with any of them.

One day, a distraught Anna appears at Will's doorstep; some pre-stardom nude photos have been published in the tabloids, and she needs a place to hide from the fallout. She also apologizes for the previous incident, telling Will her (ex-)boyfriend simply showed up out of the blue and the relationship had broken down long before then. That night, Anna goes to him and they have sex, reaffirming their love over a poster of Chagall's La Mariée. The next morning, the press (inadvertently tipped off by Spike) besiege Will's house and get pictures of him and Anna half-dressed. While packing to leave, a furious Anna accuses Will of exploiting the situation for his own benefit and declares that she regrets their time together, because the press will make sure it never goes away.

Seasons pass and Will, though determined to forget Anna, remains miserable. Spike and Honey find the numbers to Anna's New York and London agents, encouraging him to reach out, but Will decides to throw them away. At a dinner with his friends, Will discovers that Anna is now an Oscar winner and back in town making a period film. He visits her location shoot, where Anna sees him and invites him past security. Although things are not going well on set, she asks him to stay because there are ""things to say"". Given headphones to listen to the actors over their microphones, Will overhears Anna bantering with her rude co-star, until the co-star mentions seeing Will, and Anna refers to him dismissively. Saddened, Will leaves the set.

The next day, Anna comes to the bookshop with a present. Visibly nervous, she apologizes for her previous behavior and expresses a desire to rekindle their relationship. When Will points out her comments the previous day, she explains that she would never discuss her private life with ""the most indiscreet man in England."" Believing it inevitable that they would break up, Will turns her down, as her superstar status would mean he could never really escape the pain of losing her, and having it happen a third time would crush him. Although saddened, Anna accepts his decision, but reminds him that underneath all the fame, she is ""also just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.""

Will meets his friends in a restaurant with the opened gift—the original La Mariée. They take turns supporting his decision to end the relationship by (halfheartedly) pointing out Anna's flaws. When Spike enters and is told what happened, he promptly calls Will a ""daft prick"". Will reiterates Anna's last comment and realizes his mistake. They pile into Max's car and race across London to Anna's hotel, where they find that she has checked out and is holding a press conference at the Savoy Hotel. When Will arrives, Anna's publicist is telling the crowd that Anna will be taking time off from making films and leaving the UK that night. Will, pretending to be a reporter again, admits he made the wrong decision and begs Anna to reconsider. After admitting she would, Anna announces that she will be staying in Britain ""indefinitely."" Anna and Will smile at one another from across the room as the press goes into a frenzy. A montage shows their wedding and arrival at one of Anna's movie premieres, before ending with them on a bench in the private garden, Will reading to a visibly pregnant Anna.

The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974 film)_2,"In New York City, four men heavily armed with submachine guns and all donning code names (Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Grey, and Mr. Brown), wearing similar trenchcoat, glasses and mustache disguises, board the Pelham 123 subway train of the 6 Lexington Avenue Local service at different station stops (Green at 59th Street, Grey at 51st Street, Brown at Grand Central, and finally Blue at 28th Street).
The men take the train, secure a group of seventeen passengers whom they hold hostage, isolate them in the train's first car and then separate the car from the rest of the train.

Meanwhile, Lieutenant Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau), a cynical and curmudgeonly yet light-hearted New York City Transit Authority police lieutenant, begins his day by leading four visiting Tokyo Metro directors on a tour of New York's subway command-center.
This is interrupted by Blue's radio announcement to the command center that ""your train has been taken.""
Blue (Robert Shaw), the English-accented leader of the hijackers, reveals their demands: a ransom of one million dollars, to be delivered to them within one hour, otherwise they will kill one passenger per minute once the hour has passed.

Garber, the sarcastic Lieutenant Rico Patrone (Jerry Stiller), and other transit workers cooperate while trying to guess how the criminals intend to escape the subway tunnel and get away.
Caz Dolowicz, the supervisor at Grand Central takes matters into his own hands and decides to confront the hijackers personally.
As he approaches the train, Grey (Hector Elizondo) warns him to back off but he refuses, so Grey shoots him dead.
Various clues soon surface for Garber to figure out; Blue has a very distinctive English accent, while Green (Martin Balsam) has a cold and periodically sneezes over the radio, heard by Garber, who responds by saying ""Gesundheit.""
Garber surmises that as the hijackers are able to operate the train, one is probably a disgruntled transit worker.
He also learns that one of the hostages is an undercover police officer.

The mayor finally agrees to pay the ransom at the urging of his deputy mayor and his wife (""just think what you'll get in return... Eighteen sure votes."").
Conversations between the hijackers reveal that Blue was a mercenary soldier in Africa and Green was a motorman framed by the Transit Police in a drugs bust.
There is also an undercurrent of tension between Blue and Grey; Blue confides to Green that he believes Grey is ""mad"" and potentially trouble.
During the tense wait for the money, an armed police officer in the tunnel shoots at Brown (Earl Hindman), and hijackers and police exchange fire.
In retaliation, Blue kills the conductor.
The police dispatch a squad car carrying the ransom money.
When the car is wrecked in a collision, Garber daringly bluffs to buy some time, telling the hijackers that the money already has been delivered to the 28th Street Station and only the walk down the tunnel is delaying it.
A reluctant Blue agrees to the delay.

A police motorcycle completes the trip from the scene of the collision to the subway station and two unarmed officers are sent down the track on foot to deliver the money to the hijackers.
With the money finally in hand, Blue gives Garber their next demands: that electric power be restored to the subway line, that all signals in the path of the train be set to green from 28th Street to South Ferry, and all police officers be cleared from the tunnel.
Having overridden the subway car's dead-man's switch, a safety device which requires a motorman to continually press down on the throttle or else the train will stop, the hijackers get off the train and set it in motion.
As the train starts to move, the undercover officer jumps off the train and hides between the rails.
The car begins to travel faster and faster, since no one is controlling its speed.

While following the runaway train above ground, Garber becomes convinced that it is a diversion and that the hijackers must have left it.
In the tunnel, the hijackers discard their disguises and start their escape into the tunnel's emergency exit; however, Grey refuses to leave his gun behind as agreed, resulting in a stand-off with Blue, who shoots him dead.
The undercover officer, still hiding in the tracks, manages to kill Brown with one shot.
Green escapes onto the street, while Blue shoots at the officer until he wounds him.
Garber arrives after Green has gotten away and, drawing on Blue, orders him to surrender just as Blue is about to kill the officer.
Face to face at last, Blue asks Garber if the death penalty is available in the state of New York anymore.
Told that it is not, Blue responds, ""pity"", then promptly electrocutes himself by stepping onto the third rail while a horrified Garber watches.
Meanwhile the runaway car finally encounters a red signal while entering the South Ferry Loop.
The car's emergency brakes are tripped and it grinds to a halt; the remaining hostages are all safe.

The three dead hijackers are identified, and it is apparent that none has any experience piloting trains.
Garber realizes that the hijacker still at large must be the former transit employee.
He and Patrone, working their way through a list of former motormen ""discharged for cause"" (and, by implication, disgruntled), pay a visit to Harold Longman.
Longman—known to the audience as Mr. Green—is shown rolling in the packs of ransom money on the bed in his seedy efficiency apartment when Garber and Patrone knock on his door.
He hides the money quickly, then opens to the officers and bluffs his way through their questioning.
The officers find Longman's alibi weak, but start out the door, until Longman sneezes and Garber says ""Gesundheit.""
Garber then re-opens the door, and the expression on his face indicates that he knows he has just found the final hijacker.","[STR_SENT] In New York City, four men heavily armed with submachine guns and all donning code names (Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Grey, and Mr. Brown), wearing similar trenchcoat, glasses and mustache disguises, board the Pelham 123 subway train of the 6 Lexington Avenue Local service at different station stops (Green at 59th Street, Grey at 51st Street, Brown at Grand Central, and finally Blue at 28th Street).

17 Again (film)_0,"In 1989, 17 year-old Mike O'Donnell (Zac Efron) learns from his girlfriend Scarlet Porter (Allison Miller) that she is pregnant during the start of his high school championship basketball game.
Moments after the game begins, he leaves the game and goes after Scarlet, abandoning his hopes of going to college and becoming a professional basketball player.

In 2009, Mike (Matthew Perry), now 37 years old, finds his life stalled.
Scarlet (Leslie Mann) has separated from him due to his regrets about abandoning college, forcing him to move in with his geeky and wealthy best friend since high school, Ned Gold (Thomas Lennon).
At his job, we see another reason for his frustration: due to his lack of higher education and since he is significantly older than most of his co-workers, he is passed over for a promotion he deserves in favor of a much younger worker.
He gets fired from his job and his high school-age children, Maggie (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Alex (Sterling Knight) want nothing to do with him.
Later, while visiting his high school to reminisce, an encounter with a mysterious janitor (Brian Doyle-Murray) transforms Mike into his 17 year-old self.

Given the chance to re-live his youth, Mike enrolls in high school posing as Mark Gold, Ned's son, and plans to go to college with a basketball scholarship.
As he befriends his children, however, Mike comes to believe that his mission is to help them.
Mike comforts Maggie when her boyfriend Stan (Hunter Parrish), the captain of the basketball team, dumps her.
With his help, Alex overcomes Stan's bullying to obtain a place with Mike on the basketball team and the girlfriend he desires.

Through their children Mike spends time with Scarlet, who is attracted to his remarkable resemblance to her husband in high school.
Mike has difficulty resisting his desire for her despite the relationship's clear inappropriateness.
At the same time, he must fend off Maggie's amorous advances.

Mike soon realizes that Scarlet is the ""best decision"" he had ever made and finally realizes that his own selfishness has driven his family away.
He tries to re-unite with her and unsuccessfully explains to her that he is actually Mike, her husband.
On the day of the court hearing to finalize Scarlet and Mike's divorce, Mike makes one last attempt to win her back (as Mark) by reading a supposed letter from Mike.
He states that although he couldn't set things right in the beginning of his life, it doesn't extinguish the fact that he still loves her.
After he exits, Scarlet notices that the ""letter"" is actually the directions to the courtroom and she begins to grow curious.
As a result, she postpones the divorce.
During a high school basketball game, Mike reveals himself to Scarlet.
As Scarlet once again runs away down the hall, Mike decides to chase her down once more, but not before handing the ball off to his son.
Mike is then transformed back into his 37 year-old self, reunites with Scarlet, and is hired as the high school's new basketball coach.","[STR_SENT] In 1989, 17 year-old Mike O'Donnell (Zac Efron) learns from his girlfriend Scarlet Porter (Allison Miller) that she is pregnant during the start of his high school championship basketball game.

Sugar & Spice_0,"The story is narrated by Lisa Janusch (Marla Sokoloff), the bitter and jealous head cheerleader of Lincoln High School's B-squad.

Diane Weston (Marley Shelton), the popular head cheerleader of Lincoln High School's A-squad, becomes pregnant by the star football quarterback Jack Bartlett (James Marsden).
The two move out of their parents' homes to find an apartment of their own.
Jack initially has problems staying in a job, due to his tactless personality, but finally gets hired at a video rental store.
In spite of their problems coming up with the rent money, Jack and Diane try as hard as they can to survive while going to school at the same time.
Lisa, Diane's bitter rival, occasionally runs into Jack at the rental store.

She is interested in winning Jack's heart, but fails to get his attention.
After struggling with the rent and anticipating the financial hardship of supporting a family, Diane and her four cheerleader squadmates, Kansas Hill (Mena Suvari), Cleo Miller (Melissa George), Lucy Whitmore (Sara Marsh), and Hannah Wald (Rachel Blanchard), plan the perfect bank robbery.
They promise each other not to tell Jack about their plan, because of his inability to lie to others.

The squad watches heist films to learn how to rob banks, and Kansas visits her mother at the women's penitentiary for tips on where to find weaponry.
Following the women's advice, Diane and her friends visit a bug exterminator, ""The Terminator"" (W. Earl Brown), who sells illegal arms and ammo.
He refuses to sell them the guns unless they accept his daughter, Fern Rogers (Alexandra Holden), on the squad.

The squad agrees to do so and they begin rehearsing the robbery, as well as their choreography for the winter ball.
During winter break, they order masks to hide their identities.
Lucy backs out of the heist because she receives a scholarship to Harvard.
At Christmas, Diane receives an engagement ring from Jack.
She then finds out he sold his GTO in order to buy her the ring.
The squad is forced to buy a new get-away vehicle, which turns out to be an old van with bad brakes.

At their first robbery at a supermarket, Lucy returns to the group having decided to help them after all.
Lisa happens to be in the store at the time of the robbery, and notices that they perform cheerleader stunts in order to cover up the security cameras.
The squad robs the bank and come close to shooting a customer after one of the guns discharges.
They make off with armloads of cash and celebrate their success after burning their Betty costumes.
The robbery is reported on TV.
Neither Diane nor her friends expect Lisa to suspect them until they are confronted by her and the B-squad in the high school cafeteria, followed by the FBI.

Diane and her friends are jailed and need an alibi, so Diane promises to promote Lisa to captain of the A-squad in order to keep Lisa silent, since she is approaching her third trimester and can't do rigorous activity.
The group is outraged, but come to appreciate this decision.
In order to cover up her actions, Diane tells Jack she won the lottery and after they have their children, Jack wins his senatorial campaign, and Diane's squad lead successful lives after high school.","[STR_SENT] The story is narrated by Lisa Janusch (Marla Sokoloff), the bitter and jealous head cheerleader of Lincoln High School's B-squad.

Seven (film)_1,"In a city of near-constant rain and urban decay, the soon-to-be retiring Detective William Somerset is partnered with short-tempered Detective David Mills who recently transferred to the department.

The detectives investigate a series of murders relating to the seven deadly sins, such as an obese man who was forced to feed himself to death, representing ""Gluttony.""
They find clues at each crime scene related to other deaths, and believe they are chasing a serial killer.
A set of fingerprints found at the scene of the ""Greed"" murder, the fatal bloodletting of a rich attorney, leads them to an apartment where they find an emaciated man strapped to a bed.
Though he initially appears to be dead, it soon is discovered that the man has been kept alive and entirely immobile by the killer for exactly one year to the day; a drug dealer and child molester before his captivity, this victim represents ""Sloth"".
Though unable to learn anything from the insensate victim, the detectives agree that the killer has planned these crimes for more than a year.

Tracy Mills is unhappy with their recent move to the city.
She meets Somerset after the first few murders and he becomes Tracy's confidante.
Upon learning that she is pregnant but has not told her husband, Somerset confides in her his fear that the city is no place to start a family, and reveals that he had ended a relationship years earlier after pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion.
Somerset advises her to not tell Mills if she plans to have an abortion; otherwise, if she decides to keep the child, ""spoil that kid every chance you get"".

Using library records, Somerset and Mills track down a man named John Doe, who has frequently checked out books related to the deadly sins.
When Doe finds the detectives approaching his apartment, he opens fire on them and flees, chased by Mills.
Eventually, Doe gains the upper hand and holds Mills at gunpoint, but then abruptly leaves, sparing Mills's life.
Investigation of Doe's apartment finds handwritten volumes of his irrational judgments and clues leading to another potential victim, but no fingerprints.
They arrive too late to find their ""Lust"" victim, a prostitute killed by an unwilling man wearing a bladed S&M device, forced by Doe to simultaneously rape and kill her.
Some time later, they investigate the death of a young model whose face had been mutilated.
Having chosen to kill herself rather than live with a disfigured face, she is the victim of ""Pride"".

As they return to the police station, Doe appears to them and offers himself for arrest, with the blood of the model and an unidentified victim on his hands.
They find out that he has been cutting the skin off his fingers to avoid leaving fingerprints.
Through his lawyer, Doe claims he will lead the two detectives to the last two bodies and confess to the crimes, or otherwise will plead insanity.
Though Somerset is worried, Mills agrees to the demand.
Doe directs the two detectives to a remote desert area far from the city; along the way, he claims that God told him to punish the wicked and reveal the world for the awful place that it is.
He also makes cryptic comments toward Mills.

After arriving at the location, a delivery van approaches; Somerset intercepts the driver, leaving Mills and Doe alone.
The driver hands over a package he was instructed to deliver at precisely this time and location.
While Mills holds Doe at gunpoint, Doe mentions how much he admires him, but does not say why.
Somerset opens the package and recoils in horror at the sight of the contents.
He races back to warn Mills not to listen to Doe, but the killer reveals that the box contains Tracy's head.
Doe claims to represent the sin of ""Envy""; he was envious of Mills's normal life, and killed Tracy after failing to ""play husband"" with her.
He then taunts the distraught Mills with the knowledge that Tracy was pregnant.
Somerset is unable to contain Mills as he kills Doe by shooting him repeatedly, thereby becoming the embodiment of ""Wrath"" and completing Doe's ""work"".

Upon learning that she is pregnant but has not told her husband, Somerset confides in her his fear that the city is no place to start a family, and reveals that he had ended a relationship years earlier after pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion.
Somerset advises her to not tell Mills if she plans to have an abortion; otherwise, if she decides to keep the child, ""spoil that kid every chance you get"".

Using library records, Somerset and Mills track down a man named John Doe, who has frequently checked out books related to the deadly sins.
When Doe finds the detectives approaching his apartment, he opens fire on them and flees, chased by Mills.
Eventually, Doe gains the upper hand and holds Mills at gunpoint, but then abruptly leaves, sparing Mills's life.
Investigation of Doe's apartment finds handwritten volumes of his irrational judgments and clues leading to another potential victim, but no fingerprints.
They arrive too late to find their ""Lust"" victim, a prostitute killed by an unwilling man wearing a bladed S&M device, forced by Doe to simultaneously rape and kill her.
Some time later, they investigate the death of a young model whose face had been mutilated.
Having chosen to kill herself rather than live with a disfigured face, she is the victim of ""Pride"".

As they return to the police station, Doe appears to them and offers himself for arrest, with the blood of the model and an unidentified victim on his hands.
They find out that he has been cutting the skin off his fingers to avoid leaving fingerprints.
Through his lawyer, Doe claims he will lead the two detectives to the last two bodies and confess to the crimes, or otherwise will plead insanity.
Though Somerset is worried, Mills agrees to the demand.
Doe directs the two detectives to a remote desert area far from the city; along the way, he claims that God told him to punish the wicked and reveal the world for the awful place that it is.
He also makes cryptic comments toward Mills.

After arriving at the location, a delivery van approaches; Somerset intercepts the driver, leaving Mills and Doe alone.
The driver hands over a package he was instructed to deliver at precisely this time and location.
While Mills holds Doe at gunpoint, Doe mentions how much he admires him, but does not say why.
Somerset opens the package and recoils in horror at the sight of the contents.
He races back to warn Mills not to listen to Doe, but the killer reveals that the box contains Tracy's head.
Doe claims to represent the sin of ""Envy""; he was envious of Mills's normal life, and killed Tracy after failing to ""play husband"" with her.
He then taunts the distraught Mills with the knowledge that Tracy was pregnant.
Somerset is unable to contain Mills as he kills Doe by shooting him repeatedly, thereby becoming the embodiment of ""Wrath"" and completing Doe's ""work"".
After Mills is taken away, Somerset is asked where he will be, and replies, ""around"".

Shakespeare in Love_0,"William Shakespeare is a poor playwright for Philip Henslowe, owner of The Rose Theatre, in 1593 London.
Shakespeare is working on a new comedy, Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.
Suffering from writer's block, he is unable to complete the play, but begins auditions for Romeo.
A young man named Thomas Kent is cast in the role after impressing Shakespeare with his performance and his love of Shakespeare's previous work.
Kent is actually Viola de Lesseps, the daughter of a wealthy merchant who desires to act but, since women are banned from the stage, she must disguise herself.

After Shakespeare discovers his star's true identity, he and Viola begin a passionate secret affair.
Inspired by her, Shakespeare writes quickly, and benefits from the advice of playwright and friendly rival Christopher 'Kit' Marlowe, completely transforming the play into what will become Romeo and Juliet.
Shakespeare and Viola know, however, that their romance is doomed.
He is married, albeit long separated from his wife, while Viola's parents have arranged her betrothal to Lord Wessex (Colin Firth), an aristocrat who needs money.
When Viola is summoned to the court of Queen Elizabeth I, Shakespeare dons a woman's disguise to accompany her as her cousin.
At court, he persuades Wessex to bet £50 that a play cannot capture the nature of true love.
If Romeo and Juliet is a success, Shakespeare as playwright will win the money.
The Queen, who enjoys Shakespeare's plays, agrees to witness the wager.

Edmund Tilney, the Master of the Revels, the Queen's official in charge of the theatres, learns that there is a woman in the theatre company at The Rose playhouse, and orders the theatre closed for violating morality and the law.
Left without a stage or lead actor, it seems that Romeo and Juliet must close before it even opens, until Richard Burbage, the owner of a competing theatre, the Curtain, offers his stage to Shakespeare.
Shakespeare assumes the lead role of Romeo, with a boy actor playing Juliet.
Viola learns that the play will be performed on her wedding day, and after the ceremony secretly travels to the theatre.
Shortly before the play begins, the boy playing Juliet starts experiencing the voice change of puberty.
Viola replaces him and plays Juliet to Shakespeare's Romeo.
Their passionate portrayal of two lovers inspires the entire audience.

Tilney arrives at the theatre with Wessex, who has deduced his new bride's location.
Tilney plans to arrest the audience and cast for indecency, but the Queen is in attendance.
Although she recognizes Viola, the Queen does not unmask her, instead declaring that the role of Juliet is being performed by Thomas Kent.
However, even a queen is powerless to end a lawful marriage, so she orders ""Kent"" to fetch Viola so that she may sail with Wessex to the Colony of Virginia.
The Queen also states that Romeo and Juliet has accurately portrayed true love so Wessex must pay Shakespeare £50, the exact amount Shakespeare requires to buy a share in the Lord Chamberlain's Men.
The Queen then directs ""Kent"" to tell Shakespeare to write something ""a little more cheerful next time, for Twelfth Night"".

Viola and Shakespeare part, resigned to their fates.
The film closes as Shakespeare begins to write Twelfth Night, Or What You Will imagining his love washed ashore in a strange land after a shipwreck and musing, ""For she will be my heroine for all time, and her name will be...Viola"", a strong young woman castaway who disguises herself as a young man.","[STR_SENT] William Shakespeare is a poor playwright for Philip Henslowe, owner of The Rose Theatre, in 1593 London.

Youve Got Mail_0,"Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) is involved with Frank Navasky (Greg Kinnear), a leftist postmodernist newspaper writer for the New York Observer who's always in search of an opportunity to root for the underdog.
While Frank is devoted to his typewriter, Kathleen prefers her laptop and logging into her AOL e-mail account.
There, using the screen name 'Shopgirl', she reads an e-mail from ""NY152"", the screen name of Joe Fox (Tom Hanks).
In her reading of the e-mail, she reveals the boundaries of the online relationship; no specifics, including no names, career or class information, or family connections.
Joe belongs to the Fox family which runs Fox Books — a chain of ""mega"" bookstores similar to Borders or Barnes & Noble.
Kathleen, on the other hand, runs the independent bookstore The Shop Around The Corner that her mother ran before her.
The two then pass each other on their respective ways to work, where it is revealed that they frequent the same neighborhoods in upper west Manhattan.
Joe arrives at work, overseeing the opening of a new Fox Books in New York with the help of his friend, branch manager Kevin (Dave Chappelle).
Meanwhile, Kathleen and her three store assistants, George (Steve Zahn), Birdie (Jean Stapleton), and Christina (Heather Burns) open up shop for the day.

Following a day on the town with his eleven-year-old aunt Annabel (Hallee Hirsh) and four-year-old half brother Matthew (Jeffrey Scaperrotta) (the children of his frequently divorced grandfather and father, respectively), Joe enters Kathleen's store to let his younger relatives experience storytime.
Joe and Kathleen have a friendly conversation that reveals Kathleen's fears about the Fox Books store opening around the corner, shocking Joe.
He introduces himself as ""Joe.
Just call me Joe,"" omitting his last name, and makes an abrupt exit with the children.
However, at a publishing party later in the week, Joe and Kathleen meet again, both of them being in the New York book business, where Kathleen discovers Joe's true identity.

Following suggestions from Frank/Joe via ""NY152"" Kathleen begins a media war, including both a boycott of Fox Books and an interview on the local news.
All the while, ""NY152"" and ""Shopgirl"" continue their courtship, to the point where ""NY152"" asks ""Shopgirl"" to meet.
Too embarrassed to go alone, Joe brings Kevin along for moral support.
He insists that ""Shopgirl"" may be the love of his life.
Meanwhile Kevin, looking in a cafe window at the behest of Joe, discovers the true identity of ""Shopgirl.""
When Joe discovers that it is actually Kathleen behind the name, he confronts her as Joe (concealing his ""NY152"" alter ego – and feelings).
The two exchange some bitter words and Joe leaves the cafe hurt, leaving Kathleen initially remorseful.
Kathleen later returns home puzzled why NY152 might have stood her up.

Despite all efforts, The Shop Around the Corner slowly goes under.
In a somber moment Kathleen enters Fox Books to discover the true nature of the store is one of friendliness and relaxation, yet without the same dedication to children's books as her independent shop.
Eventually, her employees move on to other jobs; as Christina goes job hunting, George gets a job at the children's department at a Fox Books store (Joe later compares George's knowledge of the contents of the department to a PhD) and Birdie, who is already wealthy from investments, retires.

Allowing time for their electronic relationship to convalesce, Joe visits Kathleen while she is sick, and for the first time makes a favorable impression.
Joe discovers that Kathleen has broken up with Frank, who is starting a relationship with Sydney Ann (Jane Adams), a talk show host who interviewed him.
This predated one week by Joe and his uptight girlfriend, Patricia (Parker Posey), who broke up in their apartment building while stuck in the elevator.
Kathleen and Joe develop a tentative friendship that blossoms over the course of a few weeks and they begin to spend more time with one another.

During this time, Joe as ""NY152"" mysteriously postpones meeting Kathleen.
Finally, ""NY152"" and ""Shopgirl"" agree to meet for the first time since ""NY152"" apparently stood her up.
Joe and his dog Brinkley (the topic of numerous e-mails) meet Kathleen at Riverside Park.
Kathleen admits that she had wanted ""NY152"" to be Joe so badly, and the two kiss.","[STR_SENT] Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) is involved with Frank Navasky (Greg Kinnear), a leftist postmodernist newspaper writer for the New York Observer who's always in search of an opportunity to root for the underdog.

[END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Following a day on the town with his eleven-year-old aunt Annabel (Hallee Hirsh) and four-year-old half brother Matthew (Jeffrey Scaperrotta) (the children of his frequently divorced grandfather and father, respectively), Joe enters Kathleen's store to let his younger relatives experience storytime. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Joe and Kathleen have a friendly conversation that reveals Kathleen's fears about the Fox Books store opening around the corner, shocking Joe. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] He introduces himself as ""Joe. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Just call me Joe,"" omitting his last name, and makes an abrupt exit with the children. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] However, at a publishing party later in the week, Joe and Kathleen meet again, both of them being in the New York book business, where Kathleen discovers Joe's true identity. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Following suggestions from Frank/Joe via ""NY152"" Kathleen begins a media war, including both a boycott of Fox Books and an interview on the local news. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] All the while, ""NY152"" and ""Shopgirl"" continue their courtship, to the point where ""NY152"" asks ""Shopgirl"" to meet. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Too embarrassed to go alone, Joe brings Kevin along for moral support. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] He insists that ""Shopgirl"" may be the love of his life. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Meanwhile Kevin, looking in a cafe window at the behest of Joe, discovers the true identity of ""Shopgirl."" [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] When Joe discovers that it is actually Kathleen behind the name, he confronts her as Joe (concealing his ""NY152"" alter ego – and feelings). [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The two exchange some bitter words and Joe leaves the cafe hurt, leaving Kathleen initially remorseful. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Kathleen later returns home puzzled why NY152 might have stood her up. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Despite all efforts, The Shop Around the Corner slowly goes under. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] In a somber moment Kathleen enters Fox Books to discover the true nature of the store is one of friendliness and relaxation, yet without the same dedication to children's books as her independent shop. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Eventually, her employees move on to other jobs; as Christina goes job hunting, George gets a job at the children's department at a Fox Books store (Joe later compares George's knowledge of the contents of the department to a PhD) and Birdie, who is already wealthy from investments, retires. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Allowing time for their electronic relationship to convalesce, Joe visits Kathleen while she is sick, and for the first time makes a favorable impression. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Joe discovers that Kathleen has broken up with Frank, who is starting a relationship with Sydney Ann (Jane Adams), a talk show host who interviewed him. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] This predated one week by Joe and his uptight girlfriend, Patricia (Parker Posey), who broke up in their apartment building while stuck in the elevator. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Kathleen and Joe develop a tentative friendship that blossoms over the course of a few weeks and they begin to spend more time with one another. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] During this time, Joe as ""NY152"" mysteriously postpones meeting Kathleen. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Finally, ""NY152"" and ""Shopgirl"" agree to meet for the first time since ""NY152"" apparently stood her up. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Joe and his dog Brinkley (the topic of numerous e-mails) meet Kathleen at Riverside Park. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Kathleen admits that she had wanted ""NY152"" to be Joe so badly, and the two kiss. [END_SENT] ",2,10,13,20,32
Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)_0,"In 1890 London, private detective Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. John Watson prevent the ritual murder of a woman by Lord Henry Blackwood, who has killed five other young women similarly. Inspector Lestrade and the police arrest Blackwood. Three months later, Watson is engaged to Mary Morstan and moving out of 221B Baker Street; while he enjoys their adventures together, Watson looks forward to not having to deal with Holmes' eccentricities. Meanwhile, Blackwood has been sentenced to death and requests to see Holmes, whom he warns of three more unstoppable deaths that will cause great changes to the world. Blackwood is subsequently hanged.

Holmes is visited by Irene Adler, a former adversary who asks him to find a missing man named Luke Reordan. After her departure, Holmes follows her as she meets with her secret employer, and only learns that the man is a professor and that he intimidates Adler. Meanwhile, sightings of a living Blackwood and the discovery of his destroyed tomb lead to belief that Blackwood has risen from the grave. Reordan is found dead inside Blackwood's coffin. Following a series of clues from the body, Holmes and Watson find Reordan's home and discover experiments attempting to merge science with magic. After they survive a battle with Blackwood's men who attempt to destroy the lab, Holmes is taken to the Temple of the Four Orders, a secret magical fraternity with considerable political influence. The leaders—Lord Chief Justice Sir Thomas Rotheram, U.S. Ambassador Standish, and Home Secretary Lord Coward—ask Holmes to stop Blackwood, a former member of the society and Sir Thomas's secret illegitimate son.

That night, Sir Thomas drowns in his bath as Blackwood watches, and the next night Lord Coward calls a meeting of the Order. He nominates Blackwood to take command in place of Sir Thomas and Blackwood reveals himself to the group. Standish attempts to shoot Blackwood but is set on fire when he pulls the trigger of his gun, and runs out a window to his death. Lord Coward issues an arrest warrant for Holmes, causing him to go into hiding. Holmes studies the rituals of the Order and recognizes their symbols in Blackwood's murders that were staged at specific locations; from this he deduces the targets of the final murder are the members of Parliament. With the aid of Lestrade, Holmes fakes arrest and is taken to see Coward, where he uses evidence on Coward's clothes to deduce Blackwood has conducted a ceremony in the sewers beneath the Palace of Westminster.

Holmes escapes and he, Watson, and Adler find Blackwood's men in the sewers guarding a device based on Reordan's experiments, designed to release cyanide gas into the Parliament chambers and kill all but Blackwood's supporters, whom he has secretly given an antidote. Blackwood comes before Parliament and announces their impending deaths, then attempts to activate the cyanide device by remote control, but it is disabled by Adler. Blackwood flees Parliament and sees Adler and Holmes in the sewers, and pursues them to the top of the incomplete Tower Bridge. Blackwood fights Holmes, as the latter deduces how all of Blackwood's supposed supernatural feats were the work of science and trickery. Blackwood plummets off the bridge and falls entangled in a noose of chains, killing him when the chain wrapped around his neck hangs him. Adler explains to Holmes that her employer is Professor Moriarty, and she warns that Moriarty is as intelligent as Holmes and far more duplicitous.

As Watson moves out of 221B, the police report to him and Holmes that a dead officer was found near Blackwood's device. Professor Moriarty used the confrontations with Adler and Blackwood as a diversion while he took a key component, based on the infant science of radio, from the machine. Holmes looks forward to the new case and new adversary.

Bonnie and Clyde (film)_0,"In the middle of the Great Depression, Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) and Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) meet when Clyde tries to steal Bonnie's mother's car.
Bonnie, who is bored by her job as a waitress, is intrigued with Clyde, and decides to take up with him and become his partner in crime.
They pull off some holdups, but their amateur efforts, while exciting, are not very lucrative.

The duo's crime spree shifts into high gear once they hook up with a dim-witted gas station attendant, C.W.
Moss (Michael J. Pollard), then with Clyde's older brother Buck (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Blanche (Estelle Parsons), a preacher's daughter.
The women dislike each other on first sight, and their feud only escalates from there: shrill Blanche has nothing but disdain for Bonnie, Clyde and C.W., while gun-moll Bonnie sees Blanche's flighty presence as a constant danger to the gang's well-being.

Bonnie and Clyde turn from pulling small-time heists to robbing banks.
Their exploits also become more violent.
When C.W.
botches a bank robbery by parallel parking the getaway car, Clyde shoots the bank manager in the face after he jumps onto the slow-moving car's running board.
The gang is pursued by law enforcement, including Texas Ranger Frank Hamer (Denver Pyle), who is captured and humiliated by the outlaws, then set free.
A raid later catches the outlaws off guard, mortally wounding Buck with a gruesome shot to his head and injuring Blanche.
Bonnie, Clyde and C.W.

I Am Sam_0,"Sam Dawson (Sean Penn), a man with a developmental disability, is the single father of Lucy (Dakota Fanning), following their abandonment by her mother.
Despite his limitations, Sam is well-adjusted and has a supportive group of friends with developmental disabilities, as well as a kind, agoraphobic neighbor Annie (Dianne Wiest) who takes care of Lucy when Sam cannot.
Though Sam provides a loving and caring environment for precocious Lucy, she soon surpasses his mental ability.
Other children tease her for having a ""retard"" as a father, and she becomes too embarrassed to accept that she is more intellectually advanced than Sam.
In preparation for a custody case, a social worker turns up at Lucy's birthday party and takes her away, allowing Sam two supervised visits per week.

On the advice of his friends, Sam approaches a high-powered lawyer, Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer), whose brusque manner, fast-paced schedule and difficult personal life have earned her a reputation as cold and unfeeling.
In an attempt to prove to others that she is not heartless, Rita surprisingly agrees to take on Sam's case pro bono.
As they work together to secure Sam's parental rights, Sam unwittingly helps Rita with her family problems, including encouraging her to leave her philandering husband and repairing her fractious relationship with her son.

At the trial, Sam breaks down after opposing counsel convinces him that he is not capable of being a father.
After the trial, Lucy resides in a foster home with Randy Carpenter (Laura Dern), but tries to convince Sam to help her run away, and continually escapes in the middle of the night to go to Sam's apartment, whereupon he immediately returns her.
Ultimately, the foster family who planned to adopt Lucy decide to return her to Sam, with an arrangement that Randy will help him raise her.

The final scene depicts a soccer game, refereed by Sam, in which Lucy participates as a player.
In attendance are the foster family, Sam's friendship group, and a newly-single Rita with her son.","[STR_SENT] Sam Dawson (Sean Penn), a man with a developmental disability, is the single father of Lucy (Dakota Fanning), following their abandonment by her mother.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_0,"In 1957 during the Cold War, World War II veteran Indiana Jones and his partner George ""Mac"" McHale are kidnapped by Soviet agents under Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko.
The Soviets infiltrate a warehouse labeled ""Warehouse 51"" in Nevada and force Jones to locate a non-human corpse including a crystal skull, recovered ten years earlier.
Upon its discovery, Mac reveals he is a double agent working for the Soviets, and Jones escapes on a rocket sled.
Jones, still pursued, arrives in the model town at the Nevada Test Site, minutes before an atomic bomb test, and takes shelter in a lead-lined refrigerator.
Jones is arrested by FBI agents, who suspect him of working for the Soviets; and though freed, is put on indefinite leave of absence from Marshall College.

Jones is approached by greaser Henry ""Mutt"" Williams, who tells him that Harold Oxley had found a crystal skull in Peru, suffered a mental breakdown, and was later kidnapped.
In return, Jones tells Mutt about the legend of crystal skulls found in Akator.
Mutt gives Jones a letter from his mother, who is also held captive, containing a riddle written by Oxley in an ancient Native American language.
KGB agents try to take the letter, but Jones and Mutt evade them and reach Peru.
At the local psychiatric hospital, Oxley's scribbles on the walls of his cell lead them to the grave of Francisco de Orellana, a Conquistador searching for Akator.
They discover the skull at the grave, with Jones reasoning that Oxley had hidden it there.

Shortly afterward, Jones and Mutt are captured by the Soviets and taken to their camp, where they find Oxley and Mutt's mother, Marion Ravenwood, who later reveals that Mutt is Jones' son, Henry Jones III.
In the following struggle, Mac claims to Jones he is really a CIA double-agent to regain Jones' trust.
Spalko believes that the crystal skull belongs to an inter-dimensional alien life form and holds great psychic power, and that returning the skull to Akator will grant the Soviets the advantage of psychic warfare.
Oxley's mental conditions having devolved, Spalko uses the skull on Jones to identify a route to Akator.
Jones and his allies escape with the skull into the Amazon, elude giant ants, and survive three waterfalls in a duck boat, whereafter Jones and Oxley identify markings that lead them to Akator, unaware that Mac has been dropping transceivers to allow the Soviets to track them.

Having escaped a native tribe guarding the city and gained access to the temple, filled with artifacts from several ancient civilizations, Jones believes the aliens were ""archaeologists"" studying the different cultures of Earth.
The five enter a chamber containing the crystal skeletons of thirteen enthroned inter-dimensional beings, with one missing its skull.
Spalko places the captive skull on this skeleton, whereupon the aliens offer a reward in an language that Oxley deciphers.
Spalko demands knowledge equal to the aliens' but dies during the transference thereof, while the aliens activate a portal to their own world.
Jones, Marion, Mutt, and Oxley escape, while Mac and the Soviets are drawn into the portal.
The survivors watch as the temple walls crumble, revealing a flying saucer rising from the debris, which vanishes into the ""space between spaces"" while the void left by its departure is flooded by the Amazon waters.

Sometime later, Jones is reinstated at Marshall College and made an associate dean.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_2,"In 1957 during the Cold War, World War II veteran Indiana Jones and his partner George ""Mac"" McHale are kidnapped by Soviet agents under Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko.

The Salton Sea_0,"While playing the trumpet in a burning room, the protagonist's voice is heard in narration.
His story begins with him posing as ""Danny Parker"", a speed freak addicted to methamphetamine, who hangs out with friends while indulging in drugs.
He also moonlights as an informant for two corrupt cops, Gus Morgan (Doug Hutchison) and Al Garcetti (Anthony LaPaglia).
He is trying to set up a large meth score with notorious drug dealer Pooh Bear (D'Onofrio), an eccentric psychopath who lost his nose to excessive snorting of ""Gack"" (meth), while also attempting to set up a sting operation for Morgan and Garcetti.

When he returns home, Danny sheds his clothes and his personality, and basks in his past life as trumpet player ""Tom Van Allen"".
He reveals to an abused neighbor named Colette (Deborah Kara Unger) that he was once happily married, only to watch as his wife was gunned down by masked thieves during a stopover at the Salton Sea.

When meeting with Pooh Bear, Danny becomes fearful of Pooh Bear's displays of bizarre homicidal behavior, so he tapes a gun to the bottom of a table.

Danny's parents-in-law track him down, believing he has sunk into depression after his wife's death, but he tells them he doesn't want their help.
As the deal approaches, it becomes known that Danny is not only working for the police but FBI agents working to take down Morgan and Garcetti, who have committed multiple murders.
It is also revealed that they were the men who killed his wife and wounded him as they robbed a drug dealer.
Danny had started his own investigation when he found out who Morgan was and delved into the drug underworld to become a believable junkie.

On the night of the deal, Danny, with the help of his best friend Jimmy (Peter Sarsgaard), leads the FBI to the wrong location.
Meanwhile, Danny arrives at Pooh Bear's house.
At the dinner table, surrounded by Pooh Bear's armed friends, tensions rise and one of Pooh Bear's men tries to kill Danny, who retrieves the gun he stashed earlier and shoots the rest of the gang.
Shot in the chest by Pooh Bear, Danny collapses to the floor.

Pooh Bear, wounded in the leg, goes to take a shot of meth while mumbling incoherently.
Morgan and Garcetti arrive, find the massacre, and Garcetti kills Pooh Bear, whose drug-filled hypo drops to the floor.
Garcetti is then killed by Danny, whose life was saved by a bulletproof vest.
Morgan is shot twice by Danny, who reveals to Morgan that he knows he murdered his wife.
Morgan manages to snatch Danny's gun away, but finds it empty.
Danny finds Pooh Bear's syringe on the floor and plunges it into Morgan's neck, then picks up a pistol and briefly contemplates suicide, but then shoots Morgan several times and flees.

Back in his apartment, he dons his Tom Van Allen identity again, but is shot by Colette's ""boyfriend"" (Luis Guzman), who is actually a man Danny ratted out to the police.
Collette says she was forced to betray Danny because her daughter was being held hostage.
The room catches fire, and Danny plays one more tune on his trumpet before passing out.

He regains consciousness to find that Jimmy has saved him from the fire and taken him to a hospital.

V for Vendetta (film)_0,"In the late 2020s, the world is in turmoil, with the United States having been fractured as a result of prolonged conflict and a pandemic of the ""St. Mary's Virus"" ravaging the European continent.
The United Kingdom remains the only stable country, being ruled by the fascist Norsefire party, referred to simply as ""the party"".
Under its regime, society is heavily oppressed.
Political opponents, homosexuals and other ""undesirables"" are imprisoned in concentration camps.
On 5 November, Guy Fawkes Night, Evey Hammond, a woman who works at the state-run British Television Network (BTN), is rescued by a Guy Fawkes-masked vigilante who identifies himself as ""V"", from an attempted rape by members of the ""Fingermen"" secret police while she is out past curfew.
He leads her to a rooftop to watch his theatrical destruction of the Old Bailey.
Inspector Finch, Scotland Yard's chief of police, is given the task of investigating V's activities, while the party uses the BTN to declare the incident an ""emergency demolition"" but V takes over the broadcast to claim responsibility.
He urges the people of Britain to rise up against their government and meet him in one year, on 5 November, outside the Houses of Parliament, which he promises to destroy.
During the broadcast, the police attempt to capture V. Evey helps V escape, but is knocked out in the process.

V takes Evey to his home, where she is told she must remain until 5 November the following year.
After learning that V is killing government officials, she escapes to the home of her boss, comedian and talk show host Gordon Deitrich.
In return for Evey trusting him with her safety, Gordon reveals to her a collection of prohibited materials including subversive paintings, an antique Quran, and homoerotic photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe.
Gordon explains that he conceals his sexuality to retain his television career.
Inspector Finch learns that V is the result of experimentation on humans, and his targets tortured him while he was detained.
After Gordon performs an over-the-top satire of the government on his show, his home is raided and Evey is captured while trying to escape.
She is incarcerated and tortured for days for information about V, with her only solace being a note written by another prisoner, actress Valerie Page, who was arrested for being a lesbian.

Evey is told that she will be executed unless she reveals V's location, but when she says she would rather die she is immediately released.
It is revealed that her imprisonment and torture were staged by V to free her from her fears.
The note was real, having been passed by Valerie to V years earlier when he was similarly imprisoned.
Although Evey initially hates V for what he did to her, she realises she is now a stronger person.
She leaves him with a promise to return before 5 November.

Inspector Finch searches for the true identity of V, eventually tracing him to a bioweapons program at a detention centre for ""social deviants"" and political dissidents in Larkhill.
Finch realises that the program, directed by then-under secretary Adam Sutler, resulted in the creation of the ""St. Mary's Virus"" and its release in a false flag terrorist attack.
The deaths of 80,000 people and the resulting fear enabled the Norsefire party to win the next election, thereafter silencing opposition and turning the country into a totalitarian state.

As 5 November nears, V's distribution of thousands of Guy Fawkes masks causes chaos in the UK and the population questions party rule.
On the eve of 5 November, Evey visits V, who shows her an explosive-laden train in the abandoned London Underground set to destroy Parliament.
He leaves it to Evey to decide whether to use it, believing that he is unfit to decide.
V meets with secret police chief Creedy, who made a deal with V to hand over Sutler in exchange for V's surrender.
When Creedy executes Sutler, V refuses to surrender and is shot by Creedy's bodyguards.
V survives and kills Creedy and his men.
Mortally wounded, V returns to Evey to thank her and admits he loves her before dying in her arms.

As Evey places V's body aboard the train, she is found by Finch.
Disillusioned by the party's regime, Finch allows Evey to send the train on its way.
Thousands of unarmed Londoners wearing Guy Fawkes masks march on Parliament to watch the event.
With Sutler and Creedy dead and no one left to give commands, the military allows them to pass.
Accompanied by the 1812 Overture, Parliament is destroyed as Evey and Finch watch.
Finch asks Evey for the identity of V, to which she replies, ""He was all of us.""","[STR_SENT] In the late 2020s, the world is in turmoil, with the United States having been fractured as a result of prolonged conflict and a pandemic of the ""St. Mary's Virus"" ravaging the European continent.

The Sixth Sense_0,"Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), a child psychologist in Philadelphia, returns home one night with his wife, Anna Crowe (Olivia Williams), after having been honored for his work.
Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work.
Just then, a young man appears, and accuses Crowe of failing him.
Malcolm recognizes him as Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg), a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations.
Vincent shoots Crowe in the abdomen before turning the gun on himself.

The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, nine year old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), whose case is similar to Vincent's.
Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent.
Meanwhile, his wife hardly pays any attention to him.
At the same time, Crowe repeatedly has difficulty opening the door to his basement office.
Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees dead people, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead.

At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and plans to drop him.
Remembering Vincent, Crowe listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent, then a child.
On the tape, Crowe is heard leaving the room, and when he returned, Vincent was crying.
Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability.
He suggests to Cole that he should try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts and perhaps aid them with their unfinished business.
At first, Cole is unwilling since the ghosts terrify him, but he finally decides to do it.

Cole talks to one of the ghosts, Kyra Collins (Mischa Barton), a young ill girl who recently died.
He goes to her funeral reception with Crowe.
Kyra's ghost directs Cole to a box holding a videotape, which Cole then passes on to her father.
The video shows Kyra's stepmother intentionally making her sick, revealing the true reason she died.

Learning to live with the ghosts he sees, Cole starts to fit in at school and gets the lead in the school play, which Crowe attends.
The doctor and patient depart on positive terms and Cole suggests to Crowe that he should try speaking to Anna while she is asleep.
Later, while stuck in a traffic jam, Cole confesses his secret to his mother, Lynn (Toni Collette), saying that someone died in an accident up ahead and he knows because the person is right next to him.
Lynn does not see the recently deceased, but Cole sees a woman cyclist with blood dripping down her face.
Although his mother at first does not believe him, Cole proves his ability to her by talking about how his grandmother visits him.
He describes how his grandmother saw his mother in a dance performance even though she thought her mother was not there.
He describes to his mother how his grandmother thought she was lovely in the performance.
Lynn becomes tearful and yet amazed at the same time.
Cole says to his mother that the last time she went to where the grandmother is buried, she asked a question.
The grandmother's answer is ""Every day"".
Cole asks what the question was and mother tearfully explains that she asked her mother, ""Do I make you proud?""
With that his mother tearfully accepts the truth.

Crowe returns home, where he finds his wife asleep with their wedding video playing.
While still asleep, Anna asks her husband why he left her, and drops Crowe's wedding ring, which he suddenly discovers he has not been wearing.
He remembers what Cole said about ghosts and realizes that he was actually killed by Vincent that night, and was unknowingly dead the entire time he was working with Cole.
Due to Cole's efforts, Crowe's unfinished business—rectifying his failure to understand and help Vincent—is finally complete.
Crowe fulfills the second reason he returned: to tell his wife she was never second, and that he loves her.
His goal complete, he is free to leave the world of the living.","[STR_SENT] Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), a child psychologist in Philadelphia, returns home one night with his wife, Anna Crowe (Olivia Williams), after having been honored for his work.

Saw (film)_0,"Adam, a photographer, awakens in a bathtub in a large dilapidated bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is chained to a pipe across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man finds a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or his wife and daughter will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet, which they try to use to cut through their chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at the mirror in frustration. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant to be used for their chains, but for their feet, and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was once a suspect.

Flashbacks show that while Lawrence was discussing the terminal brain cancer of a patient named John Kramer he was approached by Detectives David Tapp and Steven Sing, who found his penlight at the scene of a Jigsaw ""game"". Lawrence's alibi cleared him, but he agreed to view the testimony of the only known survivor of one of Jigsaw's games, a heroin addict named Amanda Young, who escaped a ""reverse bear trap,"" and ultimately believes that Jigsaw helped her.

Meanwhile, Alison and Diana Gordon are being held captive in their home by a man who is watching Adam and Lawrence through a camera hidden behind the bathroom's two-way mirror. The house is simultaneously being watched by Tapp, who has since been discharged from the force. Flashbacks show that Tapp became obsessed with the Jigsaw case after Amanda's testimony and eventually found Jigsaw's warehouse using the videotape from Amanda's game. He and Sing entered the warehouse, where they apprehended Jigsaw and saved a man from a drill trap, but Jigsaw escaped after slashing Tapp's throat, and Sing was killed by a quadruple shotgun trap while pursuing him. Still convinced that Lawrence is Jigsaw, Tapp continued stalking him after his discharge.

In the bathroom, Lawrence finds a box containing two cigarettes, a lighter, and a one-way cellphone. He then recalls his abduction: he was trying to use his phone after being trapped in a parking garage, and was suddenly attacked by a pig-masked figure. They try to use a cigarette dipped in the corpse's poisoned blood to stage Adam's death, but the plan fails when Adam is zapped through his ankle chain. Adam then recalls his own abduction: he was in his photo development room when the power went out and, after finding a puppet, he was attacked by the same pig-masked figure. Alison calls Lawrence at gunpoint and tells him not to trust Adam, who admits that he was being paid to take photos of Lawrence, many of which were in the bag containing the hacksaws. Adam also reveals his knowledge of Lawrence's affair with one of his medical students, whom he had visited the night he was abducted. After urging Adam to describe the man who was paying him, Lawrence realizes that it was Tapp. Adam then finds a photo he didn't take, of a man staring out a window of Lawrence's house, whom Lawrence identifies as Zep, an orderly at his hospital. Unfortunately, the clock strikes six as he realizes this, and Zep moves to kill Alison and Diana.

Alison manages to free herself and fights Zep for the gun, after he calls Lawrence. The struggle gets Tapp's attention, and he saves Alison and Diana and chases Zep to the sewers, where he is eventually shot in the chest after a brief struggle. Lawrence, aware only of gunshots and screaming, is electrically shocked as well and loses reach of the phone. In desperation, he saws off his foot and shoots Adam with the corpse's revolver. Zep enters the bathroom to kill Lawrence because it is ""the rules"", but Adam, who only suffered a flesh wound, overpowers Zep and bludgeons him to death with the toilet tank lid. As Lawrence crawls out of the room to find help, Adam searches Zep's body for a key and finds another microcassette recorder, which reveals that Zep was another victim following rules in order to obtain an antidote for a slow-acting poison in his body. As the tape ends, the ""corpse"" rises and is revealed to be Lawrence's patient John Kramer, the real Jigsaw killer. He reveals that the key to Adam's chain was in the bathtub he woke up in, which went down the drain when Adam first woke up. Adam attempts to shoot John with Zep's gun, but John activates a remote control, shocking Adam. John then shuts off the lights, and yells ""Game Over"", before sealing the door, leaving Adam to die.

The Kids Are All Right (film)_0,"Nic (Annette Bening) and Jules (Julianne Moore) are a married lesbian couple living in California.
They have each given birth to a child using the same sperm donor.
Nic is an obstetrician, and Jules is a housewife who is starting up a landscape design business.

The younger child Laser (Josh Hutcherson) wants to find his sperm donor but has to be 18 to do so.
He begs his 18-year-old sister Joni (Mia Wasikowska) to contact the sperm bank and determines that Paul (Mark Ruffalo) is the donor.
The three meet.
Joni is impressed by his bohemian lifestyle, and Paul is enthusiastic about being in their lives.
Joni swears Laser to secrecy as she does not want to upset their mothers.
However, Jules and Nic find out and invite Paul over to dinner.
When Jules reveals she has a landscape business, Paul asks her to landscape his back garden.
Jules agrees, although Nic does not like the idea.

While working for Paul, Jules likes that he appreciates her work in contrast to Nic who, Jules feels, never supported her career.
Jules impulsively kisses Paul one afternoon, and they end up in bed together, beginning an affair.

Jules and the kids start spending more time with Paul.
Nic believes Paul undermines her authority over the children by, for example, giving Joni a ride on his motorcycle—which Nic has forbidden—and by suggesting she give Joni more freedom.
After a heated argument with Jules, Nic suggests they all have dinner at Paul's house to ease the tension.
Nic relaxes and for the first time connects with Paul.
However, Nic discovers traces of Jules's hair in Paul's bathroom and bedroom.
When they return home, Nic confronts Jules.
At first, Jules denies it but then admits to the affair.
Nic is devastated, but Jules insists she is not in love with Paul and has not turned straight; she just wanted to be appreciated.
Joni and Laser have overheard the arguments and are also upset with Jules.
The household becomes very tense with Jules sleeping on the couch.
The children are angry at Jules and Paul.
Paul thinks he has fallen for Jules and suggests she leave Nic, bring the kids, and come live with him.
Jules declines, disgusted with Paul's lack of understanding about their relationship.

The night before Joni leaves home to go to college, Paul turns up at the house.
Nic angrily confronts him, calling him an interloper, and tells him that if he wants a family, he should make one of his own.
Rejected, Paul watches Laser from outside the window, trying to get his attention, but Laser gets up from the table and leaves, ignoring him.
Later that night, Jules tearfully admits her errors to her family and begs their forgiveness.
The next morning, the family takes Joni off to college.
While Nic and Jules together hug Joni to say goodbye, they also affectionately touch each other.
During the ride home, Laser tells his mothers that they should not break up because they are too old.
Jules and Nic giggle, and the film ends with them smiling at each other and holding hands.","[STR_SENT] Nic (Annette Bening) and Jules (Julianne Moore) are a married lesbian couple living in California.

[END_SENT] [STR_SENT] He begs his 18-year-old sister Joni (Mia Wasikowska) to contact the sperm bank and determines that Paul (Mark Ruffalo) is the donor. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The three meet. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Joni is impressed by his bohemian lifestyle, and Paul is enthusiastic about being in their lives. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Joni swears Laser to secrecy as she does not want to upset their mothers. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] However, Jules and Nic find out and invite Paul over to dinner.

[END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Nic is devastated, but Jules insists she is not in love with Paul and has not turned straight; she just wanted to be appreciated.

[END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The night before Joni leaves home to go to college, Paul turns up at the house. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Nic angrily confronts him, calling him an interloper, and tells him that if he wants a family, he should make one of his own. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Rejected, Paul watches Laser from outside the window, trying to get his attention, but Laser gets up from the table and leaves, ignoring him.

25th Hour_0,"A canary yellow vintage Super Bee pulls up short on a New York City street, and Monty Brogan gets out with his buddy Kostya to look at a dog lying in the road.
The animal was mauled in a dogfight and Monty intends to shoot him but changes his mind after he looks him in the eye and decides to take him to a nearby clinic instead.

Fast forward to late 2002.
Monty is about to begin serving a seven-year prison sentence for dealing drugs.
He sits in the park with his dog, Doyle, on his last day of freedom.
He plans to meet childhood friends Frank and Jacob at a club with his girlfriend Naturelle.
Frank Slaughtery is a hotshot trader on Wall Street and Jacob Elinsky is an introverted high school teacher with a crush on one of his 11th grade students.

Monty visits his father, James, a former firefighter and recovering alcoholic who owns a bar, to confirm their plans to drive to the prison the following morning.
Monty's drug money helped him keep the bar, so a remorseful James sneaks a drink when Monty goes to the bathroom.
Facing himself in the mirror, Monty lashes out in his mind against everyone else: all the New York stereotypes he can think of, from the cabbies to the firefighters, the corner grocers to the mobsters, as if he hates them all.
Finally, he turns on himself, revealing that he is actually angry for getting greedy and having not given up drug dealing before he was caught.

Monty sold drugs for Uncle Nikolai, a Russian mobster.
Kostya tries to persuade Monty it was Naturelle who turned him in, since she knew where he hid his drugs and money.
Monty refused to turn state's evidence against Nikolai but he's not sure what Nikolai will do at the club that night.
He remembers how he met Naturelle when she was 17, hanging around his old school, and how happy they were before he was arrested.
He asks Frank to find out if it was Naturelle who betrayed him.

At the club, Jacob sees his student, Mary, so Monty invites her in with them.
Discussing what kind of a future Monty can have after prison, Frank says they can open a bar together, even though he told Jacob he believes Monty's life is over and he deserves his sentence for dealing drugs.
Frank baits Naturelle by accusing her of living high on Monty's money, not caring where it came from, but she reminds him that he knew as well and said nothing.
Jacob, meanwhile, finds the courage to kiss Mary, but both appear to be in shock afterwards and go their separate ways.

Monty and Kostya go down to talk with Uncle Nikolai, who gives Monty advice on surviving in prison.
Nikolai then reveals it was Kostya, not Naturelle, who betrayed him, and offers Monty a chance to kill Kostya in exchange for protecting his father's bar.
Monty refuses, reminding Nikolai that he asked Monty to trust Kostya in the first place.
He walks out, leaving Kostya to be killed by the Russian mobsters.

After he tells Naturelle that he's sorry he mistrusted her, Monty has one last thing to do.
He goes to the park, where he asks Jacob to look after Doyle.
Then he admits that he is terrified of being raped in prison, whereupon he asks Frank to beat him, saying if he goes in ugly he might have a chance at survival.
Frank refuses, so Monty deliberately provokes him until Jacob intervenes and Monty attacks him.
Frank is goaded into taking out his frustration, leaving Monty bruised and bloody, with a broken nose.
Frank is in tears as Monty gets up and goes home.

Naturelle tries to comfort him as Monty's father arrives to take him to Otisville.
On the drive to prison, James suggests they go west, into hiding, giving Monty one last vision of freedom.
Once again Monty sees a parade of faces from the streets of the city, followed by a vision of a future where Monty avoids imprisonment, reunites with Naturelle, starts a family, and grows old.
As the fantasy ends, we see Monty, his eyes closed and face still bruised, sitting in the passenger's seat of the car, which has driven past the bridge to the west and towards prison.","[STR_SENT] A canary yellow vintage Super Bee pulls up short on a New York City street, and Monty Brogan gets out with his buddy Kostya to look at a dog lying in the road.

Spanglish (film)_0,"The film starts with Cristina Moreno applying to Princeton University.
She tells the story of her childhood in her college essay.

Flor Moreno (Paz Vega) is a poor, Mexican single mother who is hired as the housekeeper for John (Adam Sandler) and Deborah Clasky (Téa Leoni), their kids Bernice (Sarah Steele) and Georgie (Ian Hayland), and Deborah's alcoholic mother Evelyn Wright (Cloris Leachman), a rich American family in Los Angeles.
John is head chef at a popular restaurant, Deborah is a former businesswoman turned stay-at-home mother, and Evelyn is a former jazz singer.

Flor speaks very little English.
She does not mention that she has a daughter, Cristina (Shelbie Bruce).
John, Evelyn, Georgie and Bernice are very likeable; Deborah, however, is uptight, her behavior often upsetting both households.

Summer comes and Flor is needed 24/7 at the Claskys' summer home.
Unable to communicate well in English, Deborah finds a neighbor to interpret.
Flor reveals that she is unable to maintain these hours because she has a daughter, so Cristina is invited to come stay with them.

Cristina interprets for her mother.
She impresses Deborah, who begins to treat her like a daughter, taking Cristina shopping, getting her hair done, enrolling her in a private school, and showing her more love than she does the sensitive Bernice.

Flor becomes unhappy when it appears that Cristina is influenced by Deborah, in part because she wants Cristina to keep in touch with her Mexican roots and working-class values, and partly because Deborah is overstepping her bounds.
Flor objects to Deborah's actions to John, who apologizes.

Flor loses her temper when she finds out that John has given Cristina over $600 in cash for a minor task.
She threatens to leave but John convinces her to stay for Cristina's sake.

Flor begins to learn English so she can communicate better.
She becomes closer to John, who is having difficulty with Deborah's self-centered behavior.
The now-sober Evelyn realizes that her daughter is having an affair and that her marriage is in trouble.
She pleads with Deborah to end the affair, telling her she'll never get another man as good as John.

Deborah confesses to John that she cheated on him.
John walks out and gives Flor a ride in his car.
They go to his restaurant, where he cooks for Flor and they enjoy the ""conversation of their lives,"" feeling love for one another.

Flor quits and takes her daughter home, upsetting Cristina, who got along well with the Claskys.
On their way home, she tells Cristina that she can't go to the private school anymore either, upsetting Cristina even more; she screams in the middle of the street that Flor can't do this to her and that her life is ruined.
Flor loses patience with Cristina after she asks her mother for space.
Flor explains to her daughter that she must answer the most important question of her life, at a very young age: ""Is what you want for yourself to become someone very different than me?""
Cristina considers this on their bus ride home, and they make up and embrace.

The film ends with Cristina as an adult, years later, acknowledging that her life rests firmly and happily on the simple fact that she is her mother's daughter.","[STR_SENT] The film starts with Cristina Moreno applying to Princeton University.

The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974 film)_0,"In New York City, four men heavily armed with submachine guns and all donning code names (Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Grey, and Mr. Brown), wearing similar trenchcoat, glasses and mustache disguises, board the Pelham 123 subway train of the 6 Lexington Avenue Local service at different station stops (Green at 59th Street, Grey at 51st Street, Brown at Grand Central, and finally Blue at 28th Street).
The men take the train, secure a group of seventeen passengers whom they hold hostage, isolate them in the train's first car and then separate the car from the rest of the train.

Meanwhile, Lieutenant Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau), a cynical and curmudgeonly yet light-hearted New York City Transit Authority police lieutenant, begins his day by leading four visiting Tokyo Metro directors on a tour of New York's subway command-center.
This is interrupted by Blue's radio announcement to the command center that ""your train has been taken.""
Blue (Robert Shaw), the English-accented leader of the hijackers, reveals their demands: a ransom of one million dollars, to be delivered to them within one hour, otherwise they will kill one passenger per minute once the hour has passed.

Garber, the sarcastic Lieutenant Rico Patrone (Jerry Stiller), and other transit workers cooperate while trying to guess how the criminals intend to escape the subway tunnel and get away.
Caz Dolowicz, the supervisor at Grand Central takes matters into his own hands and decides to confront the hijackers personally.
As he approaches the train, Grey (Hector Elizondo) warns him to back off but he refuses, so Grey shoots him dead.
Various clues soon surface for Garber to figure out; Blue has a very distinctive English accent, while Green (Martin Balsam) has a cold and periodically sneezes over the radio, heard by Garber, who responds by saying ""Gesundheit.""
Garber surmises that as the hijackers are able to operate the train, one is probably a disgruntled transit worker.
He also learns that one of the hostages is an undercover police officer.

The mayor finally agrees to pay the ransom at the urging of his deputy mayor and his wife (""just think what you'll get in return... Eighteen sure votes."").
Conversations between the hijackers reveal that Blue was a mercenary soldier in Africa and Green was a motorman framed by the Transit Police in a drugs bust.
There is also an undercurrent of tension between Blue and Grey; Blue confides to Green that he believes Grey is ""mad"" and potentially trouble.
During the tense wait for the money, an armed police officer in the tunnel shoots at Brown (Earl Hindman), and hijackers and police exchange fire.
In retaliation, Blue kills the conductor.
The police dispatch a squad car carrying the ransom money.
When the car is wrecked in a collision, Garber daringly bluffs to buy some time, telling the hijackers that the money already has been delivered to the 28th Street Station and only the walk down the tunnel is delaying it.
A reluctant Blue agrees to the delay.

A police motorcycle completes the trip from the scene of the collision to the subway station and two unarmed officers are sent down the track on foot to deliver the money to the hijackers.
With the money finally in hand, Blue gives Garber their next demands: that electric power be restored to the subway line, that all signals in the path of the train be set to green from 28th Street to South Ferry, and all police officers be cleared from the tunnel.
Having overridden the subway car's dead-man's switch, a safety device which requires a motorman to continually press down on the throttle or else the train will stop, the hijackers get off the train and set it in motion.
As the train starts to move, the undercover officer jumps off the train and hides between the rails.
The car begins to travel faster and faster, since no one is controlling its speed.

While following the runaway train above ground, Garber becomes convinced that it is a diversion and that the hijackers must have left it.
In the tunnel, the hijackers discard their disguises and start their escape into the tunnel's emergency exit; however, Grey refuses to leave his gun behind as agreed, resulting in a stand-off with Blue, who shoots him dead.
The undercover officer, still hiding in the tracks, manages to kill Brown with one shot.
Green escapes onto the street, while Blue shoots at the officer until he wounds him.
Garber arrives after Green has gotten away and, drawing on Blue, orders him to surrender just as Blue is about to kill the officer.
Face to face at last, Blue asks Garber if the death penalty is available in the state of New York anymore.
Told that it is not, Blue responds, ""pity"", then promptly electrocutes himself by stepping onto the third rail while a horrified Garber watches.
Meanwhile the runaway car finally encounters a red signal while entering the South Ferry Loop.
The car's emergency brakes are tripped and it grinds to a halt; the remaining hostages are all safe.

The three dead hijackers are identified, and it is apparent that none has any experience piloting trains.
Garber realizes that the hijacker still at large must be the former transit employee.
He and Patrone, working their way through a list of former motormen ""discharged for cause"" (and, by implication, disgruntled), pay a visit to Harold Longman.
Longman—known to the audience as Mr. Green—is shown rolling in the packs of ransom money on the bed in his seedy efficiency apartment when Garber and Patrone knock on his door.
He hides the money quickly, then opens to the officers and bluffs his way through their questioning.
The officers find Longman's alibi weak, but start out the door, until Longman sneezes and Garber says ""Gesundheit.""
Garber then re-opens the door, and the expression on his face indicates that he knows he has just found the final hijacker.","[STR_SENT] In New York City, four men heavily armed with submachine guns and all donning code names (Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Grey, and Mr. Brown), wearing similar trenchcoat, glasses and mustache disguises, board the Pelham 123 subway train of the 6 Lexington Avenue Local service at different station stops (Green at 59th Street, Grey at 51st Street, Brown at Grand Central, and finally Blue at 28th Street).

Ethan fought in the Civil War on the side of the Confederacy, and in the three years since that war ended he apparently fought in the Mexican revolutionary war as well. He has a large quantity of gold coins of uncertain origin in his possession, and a medal from the Mexican campaign that he gives to his eight-year-old niece, Debbie. As a former Confederate soldier, he is asked to take an oath of allegiance to the Texas Rangers; he refuses. As Rev. Captain Samuel Clayton remarks, Ethan ""fits a lot of descriptions"".

Shortly after Ethan's arrival, cattle belonging to his neighbor Lars Jorgensen are stolen, and when Captain Clayton leads Ethan and a group of Rangers to recover them, they discover that the theft was a Comanche ploy to draw the men away from their families. When they return they find the Edwards homestead in flames. Aaron, his wife Martha, and their son Ben are dead, and Debbie and her older sister Lucy have been abducted.

After a brief funeral the men set out in pursuit. They come upon a burial ground of Comanches who were killed during the raid. Ethan mutilates one of the bodies. When they find the Comanche camp, Ethan recommends a frontal attack, but Clayton insists on a stealth approach to avoid killing the hostages. The camp is deserted, and further along the trail the men ride into an ambush. Although they fend off the attack, the Rangers are left with too few men to fight the Indians effectively. They return home, leaving Ethan to continue his search for the girls with only Lucy's fiancé, Brad Jorgensen and Debbie's adopted brother, Martin Pawley. Ethan finds Lucy brutally murdered and presumably raped in a canyon near the Comanche camp. In a blind rage, Brad rides directly into the Indian camp and is killed.

When winter arrives Ethan and Martin lose the trail and return to the Jorgensen ranch. Martin is enthusiastically welcomed by the Jorgensens' daughter Laurie, and Ethan finds a letter waiting for him from a trader named Futterman, who claims to have information about Debbie. Ethan, who would rather travel alone, leaves without Martin the next morning, but Laurie provides Martin with a horse to catch up. At Futterman's trading post, Ethan and Martin learn that Debbie has been taken by Scar, the chief of the Nawyecka band of Comanches. A year or more later, Laurie receives a letter from Martin describing the ongoing search. In reading the letter aloud, Laurie narrates the next few scenes, in which Ethan kills Futterman for trying to steal his money, Martin accidentally buys a Comanche wife, and the two men find a portion of Scar's band killed by soldiers.

The search leads Ethan and Martin to a military fort, and then to New Mexico, where a Mexican man leads them to Scar. They find Debbie after five years, now an adolescent, living as one of Scar's wives. She tells the men that she has become a Comanche, and wishes to remain with them. Ethan would rather see her dead than living as an Indian, and tries to shoot her, but Martin shields her with his body and a Comanche wounds Ethan with an arrow as they escape. Although Martin tends to Ethan's wound, he is furious with him for attempting to kill Debbie, and wishes him dead. ""That'll be the day,"" Ethan replies, as they return home.

Meanwhile, Charlie McCorry has been courting Laurie in Martin's absence. Ethan and Martin arrive home just as Charlie and Laurie's wedding is about to begin. After a fistfight between Martin and Charlie, a nervous ""Yankee"" soldier, Lt. Greenhill, arrives with news that Ethan's half-crazy friend Mose Harper has located Scar. Clayton leads his men to the Comanche camp, this time for a direct attack, but Martin is allowed to sneak in ahead of the assault to find Debbie, who welcomes him. Martin kills Scar during the battle, and Ethan scalps him. Ethan then locates Debbie, and pursues her on horseback. Martin fears that he will shoot her as he has promised; but instead he sweeps her up onto his saddle. ""Let’s go home,"" he says. Debbie is brought to the Jorgensen ranch, and Martin reunites with Laurie. In an iconic closing scene, Ethan departs the homestead as he arrived—alone—clutching his arm, the cabin door slowly shutting on his receding image.

The Shipping News (film)_0,"Quoyle's father tosses him into the water, expecting him to naturally swim. The image of struggling to swim returns to Quoyle's mind in times of crisis.

Quoyle lives a lonely life and works as an inksetter in a small newspaper in Poughkeepsie, New York. He becomes infatuated with a vivacious local woman named Petal, marrying her and having a daughter they name Bunny. Six years later, Petal runs off with a lover and Bunny, only to die soon after in a car accident. Bunny is returned by the police to Quoyle, who tell him that Petal had sold their daughter off for $6,000 to an illegal adoption agency. Only days before Quoyle had received the news that his ailing parents killed one another in a suicide pact. After collecting their ashes, Quoyle's aunt Agnis arrives wishing to pay her respects to her brother. Agnis is moving to the ancestral family home in Newfoundland, which has been abandoned for 44 years. Realizing that Quoyle is at a total loss through grief, she first offers to stay a few more days and help him through the crisis, and then persuades him to move with her.

While struggling to rebuild his life, fix up the derelict house, and care for his daughter, Quoyle meets local resident Wavey Prowse, a widow who has a pre-teen boy with a learning disability. Wavey's son and Quoyle's daughter become friends, while the two adults become friends, and then more. Wavey has dark secrets in her past, but so does the Quoyle family.

To support himself and his daughter, Quoyle takes a job at the local newspaper Gammy Bird as the ""Shipping News"" correspondent, covering shipping traffic in town, as well as local car crashes. With no experience in journalism, Quoyle struggles to produce decent articles and incurs the dislike of the newspaper's second in command, Tert Card. An article Quoyle writes about a millionaire's yacht docked in town, however, becomes a great success with readers, and the newspaper's editor, Jack Buggit, is so impressed that he commissions him to write a series of articles profiling boats and the personal history of their owners.

A storm destroys the Quoyle home, and Jack, caught in the rope of a lobster pot while fishing, is believed drowned. His body is recovered, appears to be dead, but is actually in a deep state of shock resulting from hypothermia. During his wake, at his home in front of mourners, he regains consciousness.

The Silence of the Lambs (film)_0,"Clarice Starling is pulled from her training at the FBI Academy at Quantico, Virginia by Jack Crawford of the Bureau's Behavioral Science Unit.
He tasks her with interviewing Hannibal Lecter, a former psychiatrist and incarcerated cannibalistic serial killer, believing Lecter's insight might be useful in the pursuit of a serial killer nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"", who skins his female victims' corpses.

Starling travels to the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, where she is led by Frederick Chilton to Lecter's solitary quarters.
Although initially pleasant and courteous, Lecter grows impatient with Starling's attempts at ""dissecting"" him and rebuffs her.
As she is leaving, one of the prisoners flicks semen at her.
Lecter, who considers this act ""unspeakably ugly"", calls Starling back and tells her to seek out an old patient of his.
This leads her to a storage shed where she discovers a man's severed head.
She returns to Lecter, who tells her that the man is linked to Buffalo Bill.
He offers to profile Buffalo Bill on the condition that he be transferred away from Chilton, whom he detests.

When Buffalo Bill kidnaps a US Senator's daughter, Catherine Martin, Crawford authorizes Starling to offer Lecter a fake deal promising a prison transfer if he provides information that helps find Buffalo Bill and rescue the abductee.
Instead, Lecter begins a game of quid pro quo with Starling, offering comprehensive clues and insights about Buffalo Bill if Starling will give him information about her own past, something she was advised not to do.
Chilton secretly records the conversation and reveals Starling's deal as a sham before offering to transfer Lecter in exchange for a deal of Chilton's own making.
Lecter agrees and is flown to Memphis, Tennessee, where he reveals personal information on Buffalo Bill to federal agents.

As the manhunt begins, Starling visits Lecter at his special cell in a Tennessee courthouse and confronts him with her decryption of the name he provided (""Louis Friend"", an anagram of ""iron sulfide"", also known as fool's gold).
Lecter refuses Starling's pleas for the truth and forces her to recount her traumatic childhood.
She tells him how she was orphaned and relocated to a relative's farm in Montana, where she discovered a lamb slaughterhouse and even made a failed attempt to rescue one of them.
Lecter gives her back the case files on Buffalo Bill after their conversation is interrupted by Chilton and the police who escort her from the building.
Later that evening, Lecter kills his guards, escapes from his cell and disappears.

Starling analyzes Lecter's annotations to the case files and realizes that Buffalo Bill knew his first victim personally.
Starling travels to the victim's hometown and discovers that Buffalo Bill was a tailor, with dresses and dress patterns identical to the patches of skin removed from each of his victims.
She telephones Crawford to inform him that Buffalo Bill is trying to fashion a ""woman suit"" of real skin, but Crawford is already en route to make an arrest, having cross-referenced Lecter's notes with hospital archives and finding a man named Jame Gumb, who once applied unsuccessfully for a sex-change operation.
Starling continues interviewing friends of Buffalo Bill's first victim in Ohio while Crawford leads an F.B.I. tactical team to Gumb's address in Illinois.
The house in Illinois is empty and Starling is led to the house of ""Jack Gordon"", who she realizes is actually Jame Gumb.
She pursues him into his multi-room basement, where she discovers that Catherine is still alive, but trapped in a dry well.
After turning off the basement lights, Gumb stalks Starling in the dark with night-vision goggles but gives his position away when he cocks his revolver; Starling turns around just in time and kills him.

Some time later at her FBI Academy graduation party, Starling receives a phone call from Lecter, who is at an airport in Bimini.
He assures her that he does not plan to pursue her and asks her to return the favor, which she says she cannot do.
Lecter then hangs up the phone, saying that he is ""having an old friend for dinner"" and begins following a newly arrived Chilton before disappearing into the crowd.

Basic Instinct_0,"When retired rock star Johnny Boz has his hands tied to the bedpost with a white silk scarf and is viciously stabbed to death with an ice pick during sex in a bed by a mysterious blonde woman at his apartment, homicide detective Nick Curran is sent to investigate.
The only suspect is Catherine Tramell, a crime novelist who was the last person to be seen with Boz on the night he died.
Nick and his partner, Gus Moran, visit her Pacific Heights mansion, but they find only Catherine's lesbian lover, Roxy, who sends them to Catherine's beach house at Stinson Beach.
When they ask Catherine about her relationship with Boz, she states that she came to her beach house instead of Boz's apartment and shows little emotion at hearing he is dead.
Nick and Gus, along with their superiors, discover that Catherine has written a novel about a former rock star who was killed in the same manner as Boz (stabbed in bed with an ice pick, hands tied together with a silk scarf).
During questioning by detectives, including Nick, at police headquarters, Catherine engages in provocative behavior, refuses to extinguish her cigarette, and re-crosses her legs — her short skirt revealing that she is not wearing underwear.
She then takes a lie detector polygraph which she passes.

Nick, who accidentally shot two tourists while high on cocaine, attends counseling sessions with police psychologist Dr. Beth Garner, with whom he has had an affair.
Nick goes to a bar with co-workers after the interrogation and is taunted by Lieutenant Marty Nilsen, an internal affairs investigator who is jealous of Nick's past case and constantly calls him ""shooter"".
Beth arrives and Nick leaves with her.
They go to her apartment, where aggressive foreplay escalates nearly into rape.
Nick learns that Catherine has a troubled history: Her parents were killed in a boating accident when she was an adolescent, leaving her a fortune; one of her college counselors, Noah Goldstein, was stabbed in his sleep with an ice pick when Catherine was attending UC Berkeley, and her former fiancé, boxer Manny Vasquez, was killed in the ring during a prize fight in Atlantic City.
Nick also discovers that Catherine makes a habit of befriending murderers, including Hazel Dobkins, a woman who stabbed her husband and children for no apparent reason.

During a visit to her beach house, Catherine taunts Nick, knowing of his past case and calls him ""shooter"" just as Nilsen did.
Knowing Beth is the only person with access to what information Catherine told him, he confronts Beth and she admits that she handed his file to Nilsen and later explains to Nick that Nilsen threatened to discharge Nick if he could not evaluate him directly.
An enraged Nick storms into Nilsen's office, assaults him, and accuses him of having sold Nick's file to Catherine.
Nilsen suspends Nick and he goes home and spends the evening drinking.
Beth visits him but he throws her out after a heated argument.
Nilsen is found dead in his car later that night, shot once in the head with a .38 caliber revolver.
Nick is the prime suspect because of their recent altercation.

A torrid affair between Nick and Catherine begins with the air of a cat-and-mouse game.
Catherine explains that she will base her next novel's character — a cop falling for the wrong woman only to be killed by her — on Nick, while at the same time he declares his love for her and his unchanged intention to nail her for Boz's murder.
Catherine and Nick have a drink in his house.
The pair later dance provocatively at Boz's dance club and have sex in bed.
Although Catherine ties Nick to the bedpost with a white silk scarf, she does not pull an ice pick out of the bed like Boz's killer did.","[STR_SENT] When retired rock star Johnny Boz has his hands tied to the bedpost with a white silk scarf and is viciously stabbed to death with an ice pick during sex in a bed by a mysterious blonde woman at his apartment, homicide detective Nick Curran is sent to investigate.

Alien (film)_0,"The commercial towing spaceship Nostromo, owned and operated by the Earth mega-corporation Weyland-Yutani, is on a return trip to Earth hauling a refinery and twenty million tons of mineral ore, with a seven-member crew in stasis.
Detecting a transmission of unknown origin from a nearby planetoid, the ship's computer awakens the crew.
[14] Acting on standing orders from their corporate employers, they set out to investigate the transmission's source.
The Nostromo lands on the planetoid, and Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), Executive Officer Kane (John Hurt), and Navigator Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) set out to investigate the signal, leaving Warrant Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Science Officer Ash (Ian Holm), and Engineers Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) behind on the ship.

Dallas, Kane, and Lambert discover that the signal is coming from a derelict alien spacecraft.
Inside they find the remains of a large alien creature whose ribs appear to have been broken outward from the inside.
Meanwhile, Ripley determines that the transmission is actually some type of warning rather than a distress signal.
Kane discovers a vast chamber containing thousands of eggs, one of which releases a creature that attaches to his face.
Rendered unconscious, Kane is carried back to the Nostromo.
Acting on improper orders from Dallas, Ash violates quarantine protocol by opening the airlock, allowing the exploratory team aboard.
After an unsuccessful attempt by Ash to surgically remove the creature from Kane's face, the crew discover that the creature's blood contains a corrosive acid.
The creature eventually detaches from Kane's face by itself and is later found dead.
The Nostromo leaves the planet and resumes its trip to Earth.

Kane awakens from his ordeal with some memory loss but no other apparent ill effects.
During the crew's final dinner before re-entering stasis, he chokes and convulses until a small alien creature bursts from his chest, killing him.
The creature escapes into the ship and, lacking conventional weapons, the crew attempts to locate and capture it by fashioning motion trackers, electric prods, and flamethrowers.
However, the Alien has grown at an unprecedented rate and is now eight feet tall with incredible strength and agility.
It attacks Brett and disappears with his body into an airshaft.
Dallas enters the airshaft network intending to force the Alien into an airlock, but it ambushes him.
When the others find no trace of Dallas, Lambert, realizing that the alien is aggressive and intent on killing the entire crew, implores the remaining crew members to escape in the ship's shuttle.
Ripley, now in command, explains that the shuttle will not support four people, and recommends that they continue with Dallas's plan of cornering and flushing out the Alien.

Accessing the ship's computer, Ripley discovers that Ash has been ordered to return the Alien to their corporate employers even at the expense of the crew's lives.
Ash then appears and attacks Ripley, but Parker and Lambert intervene, decapitating and impaling Ash, revealing him to be an android.
Ripley theorizes that the company wants the Alien for its weapons division.
Before they destroy his remains, Ash smugly predicts that the others will not survive the indestructible ""perfect organism"" that they are up against.
The three remaining crew members then agree to arm the Nostromo's self-destruct mechanism and escape in the shuttle, but Parker and Lambert are ambushed and killed by the Alien while gathering necessary coolant supplies.
Now alone, Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence herself and heads for the shuttle with the crew's cat, but finds the Alien blocking her way.
She retreats and unsuccessfully attempts to abort the self-destruct, then returns to find the Alien gone and narrowly escapes in the shuttle as the Nostromo explodes.

As she prepares to enter stasis, Ripley discovers that the Alien has hidden aboard the shuttle.
She puts on a spacesuit and opens the shuttle's main door, causing explosive decompression which forces the Alien to the shuttle's open doorway.
She propels it out into space by shooting it with a grappling hook, but the gun catches in the closing door, tethering the Alien to the shuttle.
As it attempts to crawl into one of the engines, Ripley activates them and blasts the alien into space.

Vertigo (film)_0,"After a rooftop chase, where his acrophobia and vertigo result in the death of a policeman, San Francisco detective John ""Scottie"" Ferguson retires.
Scottie tries to conquer his fear, but his ex-fiancée Midge Wood suggests another severe emotional shock may be the only cure.

An acquaintance from college, Gavin Elster, asks Scottie to follow his wife, Madeleine, claiming she has been possessed.
Scottie reluctantly agrees, and follows Madeleine: to a florist where she buys a bouquet of flowers; to the grave of Carlotta Valdes; to an art museum where she gazes at Portrait of Carlotta, which resembles her.
Lastly, she enters the McKittrick Hotel, but when Scottie investigates, she is not there.

A local historian explains that Carlotta Valdes tragically committed suicide.
Gavin reveals that Carlotta (who Gavin fears is possessing Madeleine) is Madeleine's great-grandmother, although Madeleine has no knowledge of this, and does not remember where she has visited.
Scottie tails Madeleine to Fort Point, and she leaps into San Francisco Bay.
Scottie rescues her.

The next day Scottie follows Madeleine; they meet and spend the day together.
They travel to Muir Woods and Cypress Point on 17-Mile Drive, where Madeleine runs down towards the ocean.
Scottie grabs her and they embrace.
Scottie identifies the setting of Madeleine's nightmare as Mission San Juan Bautista.
He drives her there and they express their love for each other.
Madeleine suddenly runs into the church and up the bell tower.
Scottie, halted on the steps by his vertigo, sees Madeleine plunge to her death.

The death is declared a suicide.
Gavin does not fault Scottie, but Scottie breaks down, becomes clinically depressed and is in a sanatorium, almost catatonic.
After release, Scottie frequents the places that Madeleine visited, often imagining that he sees her.
One day, he notices a woman who reminds him of Madeleine, despite her vulgar appearance.
Scottie follows her and she identifies herself as Judy Barton, from Salina, Kansas.

A flashback reveals that Judy was the person Scottie knew as ""Madeleine Elster""; she was impersonating Gavin's wife as part of a murder plot.
Judy writes to Scottie explaining her involvement with Gavin's murder of his wife.
Gavin had deliberately taken advantage of Scottie's acrophobia to substitute his wife's freshly dead body in the apparent ""suicide jump"".
Judy rips up the letter and decides to continue the charade, because she loves Scottie.

They begin seeing each other, but Scottie remains obsessed with ""Madeleine"" and asks Judy to change her clothes and hair so that she once more resembles Madeleine.
When Judy complies, hoping that they may finally find happiness together, he notices her wearing the necklace portrayed in the painting of Carlotta and realizes the truth, he insists on driving her to the Mission.

There, he tells her he must re-enact the event that led to his madness, admitting he now understands that ""Madeleine"" and Judy are the same.
Scottie forces her up the bell tower and makes her admit her deceit.
Scottie reaches the top, finally conquering his acrophobia.
Judy confesses that Gavin paid her to impersonate a ""possessed"" Madeleine; Gavin faked the suicide by throwing the body of his wife from the bell tower.

Judy begs Scottie to forgive her, because she loves him.
He embraces her, but a nun rises from the trapdoor like a ghost.
Judy steps back and falls to her death.
Scottie, bereft again, stands on the ledge while the horrified nun rings the mission bell.","[STR_SENT] After a rooftop chase, where his acrophobia and vertigo result in the death of a policeman, San Francisco detective John ""Scottie"" Ferguson retires.

My Girl (film)_0,"In the summer of 1972 in Madison, Pennsylvania, Vada Sultenfuss (Anna Chlumsky) is an 11-year-old tomboy and a hypochondriac.
Vada's father, Harry Sultenfuss (Dan Aykroyd), is an awkward widower who does not understand his daughter, so he constantly ignores her.
His profession as a funeral director, for which the Sultenfuss' residence serves as a funeral parlor, has led Vada to develop an obsession with death.
She thinks that she killed her mother, who died giving birth to her.
Vada regularly tends to her invalid grandmother Gramoo (Ann Nelson), who suffers from Alzheimer's disease.
Harry's brother Phil (Richard Masur), who lives nearby, also stops by frequently to help out the family.

Vada is teased by other girls and her best friend is Thomas J. Sennett (Macaulay Culkin), an unpopular boy who is allergic to ""everything.""
One day, Vada gets squirted with a water gun by Thomas J., which makes Vada chase Thomas J. into the woods.
Once there, they throw rocks at a hornet's nest and end up getting chased by hornets.
During the encounter, Vada loses her mood ring.

Vada's summer begins well.
She befriends Shelly DeVoto (Jamie Lee Curtis), the new make-up artist at her father's funeral parlor, who provides her with some much needed guidance.
She is also infatuated with her teacher, Mr. Bixler (Griffin Dunne), and steals some money from Shelly's trailer to attend a summer writing class that he is teaching.
Soon things start to fall apart.

Her father and Shelly start dating and get engaged.
Vada experiences her first menstrual cycle; Shelly explains it after Vada runs around the house yelling that she is hemorrhaging.
A couple of days later, Vada and Thomas J. sit at the dock by the river, where they share an innocent first kiss.
Thomas J. later goes into the forest to look for Vada's mood ring and finds it, but is stung by hornets from the detached nest, which Harry believed he had stepped on, and dies of an allergic reaction (and also loses his glasses).
Soon after, Vada discovers that Mr. Bixler is about to get married to someone else.
Shelly and Harry get into an argument at Thomas J.
's funeral, and Shelly angrily tells Harry that life isn't just about death, as well as not to ignore the living, especially his daughter.

Vada's grief manages to mend the rift between her and her father.
She learns that her mother's death after her birth wasn't her fault (since her father explains to her that things like mothers dying in childbirth are not anybody's fault; they just happen without explanation).

Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)_0,"During the 19th century, the Bennet family, consisting of Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet and their five daughters—Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia—live in comparative financial independence as gentry at Longbourn, a working farm in rural England. As the Bennets have no sons, Longbourn is destined to be inherited by Mr. Bennet's cousin, Mr. Collins, so Mrs. Bennet is anxious to marry off her five daughters before Mr. Bennet dies to secure herself in her widowhood.

Wealthy bachelor Charles Bingley has recently moved into Netherfield, a nearby estate. He is introduced to local society at an assembly ball, along with his haughty sister Caroline and reserved friend, Mr. Darcy, who ""owns half of Derbyshire"". Bingley is enchanted with the gentle and beautiful Jane, while Elizabeth takes an instant dislike to Darcy after he coldly rebuffs her attempts at conversation and she later overhears him insulting her. When Jane becomes sick on a visit to Netherfield, Elizabeth goes to stay with her, verbally sparring with both Caroline and Darcy.

Later the Bennets are visited by Mr. Collins, a clergyman who is in awe of his patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. During dinner the family has some fun at Mr. Collins' expense and afterward are treated to a reading by him of Fordyce's Sermons. After learning from Mrs. Bennet that Jane is expected to become engaged soon, Collins decides to pursue Elizabeth. Meanwhile, the charming Lieutenant Wickham of the newly-arrived militia captures the girls' attention; he wins Elizabeth's sympathy by telling her that Darcy cheated him of his inheritance.

At a ball at Netherfield, Elizabeth, startled by Darcy's abrupt appearance and request for a dance, accepts his offer but vows to her best friend Charlotte Lucas that she has ""sworn to loathe him for all eternity"". During the dance, she attacks him with witty sarcasm and Darcy responds in kind. At the same ball, Charlotte expresses concern to Elizabeth that Jane's behaviour towards Mr. Bingley is too reserved and that Bingley may not realise that she loves him.

The next day at Longbourn, Collins proposes to Elizabeth but she strongly declines. When Bingley unexpectedly returns to London, Elizabeth dispatches a heartbroken Jane to the city to stay with their aunt and uncle, the Gardiners, in hopes of re-establishing contact between Jane and Bingley. Later, Elizabeth is astonished to learn that her friend Charlotte will marry Collins to gain financial security and avoid remaining a spinster. Months later, Elizabeth visits the newly-wed Mr. and Mrs. Collins who live in a cottage at Rosings, Lady Catherine's manor estate; they are invited to dine at Rosings and there meet Darcy, who is Lady Catherine's nephew, and Colonel Fitzwilliam, Darcy's friend. Here, Darcy begins to show a greater interest in Elizabeth. The next day, not realizing that Jane is Elizabeth's sister, Colonel Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth that Darcy had separated Bingley from Jane. Distraught, Elizabeth flees from a church service that all are attending, but Darcy follows her and proposes marriage.

He says he loves her ""most ardently"" despite her ""lower rank"". Elizabeth refuses him, citing his treatment of Jane and Wickham; they argue fiercely, with Darcy explaining that he had been convinced that Jane did not return Bingley's love. Darcy insults Elizabeth's family, which makes Elizabeth angrier. She hurls biting words at him. Darcy leaves angry and heartbroken. That evening, he finds Elizabeth at the Collins cottage and presents her with a letter explaining his side of events. Darcy gives insight to Wickham's character and describes exploits including Wickham's attempted elopement with Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana. The letter concludes with Darcy explaining the reasons why he separated Bingley and Jane.

A couple of months later, the Gardiners take Elizabeth on a trip to the Peak District; their tour includes Darcy's estate, Pemberley. Elizabeth, who first asks to skip a visit to the estate, agrees to go with them, believing Darcy is in London. Elizabeth is impressed by Pemberley's wealth and beauty. During the visit, she accidentally runs into Darcy who has arrived home early. He later invites her and the Gardiners to dine the next day. Darcy's manners have softened considerably, and Georgiana, having heard flattering things about her from her brother, tells Elizabeth that she already likes her.

Later in the day, when Elizabeth learns that her youngest sister Lydia has run away with Wickham, she tearfully blurts out the news to Darcy and the Gardiners before returning home. Her family expects social ruin for having a disgraced daughter, but over a week later they are relieved to hear that Mr. Gardiner had discovered the pair in London and that they had married. Lydia later lets slip to Elizabeth that Darcy was the one who found them and paid for their marriage.

Bingley and Darcy suddenly return to Netherfield; Bingley proposes to Jane and she accepts. The same evening, Lady Catherine unexpectedly visits Elizabeth, insisting that she renounce Darcy. Elizabeth refuses the request and, unable to sleep, walks on the moor at dawn. There, she meets Darcy, also unable to sleep after hearing of his aunt's behaviour. He admits his continued love and Elizabeth accepts his proposal.

Mr. Bennet gives his consent after Elizabeth assures him of her love for Darcy. In the U.S. release of the film, an additional last scene shows the newlyweds outside at Pemberley happy togeher.

Pretty Woman_0,"Edward Lewis (Gere), a successful businessman and ""corporate raider"", takes a detour on Hollywood Boulevard to ask for directions.
Receiving little help, he encounters a prostitute named Vivian Ward (Roberts) who is willing to assist him in getting to his destination.

The morning after, Edward hires Vivian to stay with him for a week as an escort for social events.
Vivian advises him that it ""will cost him,"" and Edward agrees to give her $3,000 and access to his credit cards.
Vivian then goes shopping on Rodeo Drive, only to be snubbed by saleswomen who disdain her because of her unsophisticated appearance.
Initially, hotel manager Barnard Thompson (Hector Elizondo) is also somewhat taken aback.
But he relents and decides to help her buy a dress, even coaching her on dinner etiquette.
Edward returns and is visibly amazed by Vivian's transformation.
The business dinner does not end well, however, with Edward making clear his intention to dismantle Morse's corporation once it was bought, close down the shipyard which Morse spent 40 years building, and sell the land for real estate.
Morse and his grandson abandon their dinner in anger, while Edward remains preoccupied with the deal afterward.
Back at the hotel, Edward reveals to Vivian that he had not spoken to his recently deceased father for 14 and half years.
Later that night, the two make love on the grand piano in the hotel lounge.

The next morning, Vivian tells Edward about the snubbing that took place the day before.
Edward takes Vivian on a shopping spree.
Vivian then returns, carrying all the bags, to the shop that had snubbed her, telling the salesgirls they had made a big mistake.

The following day, Edward takes Vivian to a polo match where he is interested in networking for his business deal.
While Vivian chats with David Morse, the grandson of the man involved in Edward's latest deal, Philip Stuckey (Edward's attorney) wonders if she is a spy.
Edward re-assures him by telling him how they met, and Philip (Jason Alexander) then approaches Vivian and offers to hire her once she is finished with Edward, inadvertently insulting her.
When they return to the hotel, she is furious with Edward for telling Phillip about her.
She plans to leave, but he apologizes and persuades her to see out the week.
Edward leaves work early the next day and takes a breath-taking Vivian on a date to the opera in San Francisco in his private jet.
She is clearly moved by the opera (which is La Traviata, whose plot deals with a rich man tragically falling in love with a courtesan).

While playing chess with Edward after returning, Vivian persuades him to take the next day off.
They spend the entire day together, and then have sex, in a personal rather than professional way.
Just before she falls asleep, Vivian admits that she's in love with Edward.
Over breakfast, Edward offers to put Vivian up in an apartment so he can continue seeing her.
She feels insulted and says this is not the ""fairy tale"" she wants.
He then goes off to work without resolving the situation.
Vivian's friend, Kit De Luca (Laura San Giacomo), comes to the hotel and realizes that Vivian is in love with Edward.

Edward meets with Mr. Morse, about to close the deal, and changes his mind at the last minute.
His time with Vivian has shown him another way of living and working, taking time off and enjoying activities for which he initially had little time.
As a result, his strong interest towards his business is put aside.
He decides that he would rather help Morse than take over his company.
Furious, Philip goes to the hotel to confront Edward, but only finds Vivian there.
He blames her for changing Edward and tries to rape her.
Edward arrives in time to stop Philip, chastising him for his greed and ordering him to leave the room.

Edward tends to Vivian and tries to persuade her to stay with him because she wants to, not because he's paying her.
She refuses once again and returns to the apartment she shares with Kit, preparing to leave for San Francisco to earn a G.E.D.
in the hopes of a better life.
Edward gets into the car with the chauffeur that took her home.
Instead of going to the airport, he goes to her apartment arriving accompanied by music from La Traviata.
He climbs up the fire escape, despite his fear of heights, with a bouquet of roses clutched between his teeth, to woo her.

His leaping from the white limousine, and then climbing the outside ladder and steps, is a visual urban metaphor for the knight on white horse rescuing the ""princess"" from the tower, a childhood fantasy Vivian told him about.

Jurassic Park (film)_0,"John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), the founder and CEO of bioengineering company InGen, has created a theme park called Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar, a tropical island near Costa Rica, populated with cloned dinosaurs.
After a park worker is killed by a Velociraptor, the park's investors, represented by the lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), demand that experts visit the park and certify it as safe.
Gennaro invites the mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) while Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern).
Upon arrival on Isla Nublar, the group is stunned to see a Brachiosaurus and a herd of Parasaurolophus in the distance.

At the visitor center, the crew learns through an explanatory video and a tour through a laboratory that the cloning was accomplished by extracting the DNA of dinosaurs from mosquitoes that had been preserved in amber.
However, the strands of DNA were incomplete, so DNA from frogs was used to fill in the gaps.
The dinosaurs were all cloned genetically as females in order to prevent breeding.

The group is then joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim Murphy (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello) for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees the trip from the park's control room.
However, the tour does not go as planned, with most of the dinosaurs failing to appear and a Triceratops becoming ill. As a tropical storm approaches Isla Nublar, most of the park employees depart on a boat for the mainland and the visitors return to the electric tour vehicles, except Ellie, who stays with the park's veterinarian to study the Triceratops.

During the storm, Jurassic Park's computer programmer, Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight), who has secretly been paid by a corporate rival to steal dinosaur embryos, deactivates the park's security system to allow him access to the embryo storage room.

[END_SENT] [STR_SENT] After a park worker is killed by a Velociraptor, the park's investors, represented by the lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), demand that experts visit the park and certify it as safe. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Gennaro invites the mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) while Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern). [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Upon arrival on Isla Nublar, the group is stunned to see a Brachiosaurus and a herd of Parasaurolophus in the distance. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] At the visitor center, the crew learns through an explanatory video and a tour through a laboratory that the cloning was accomplished by extracting the DNA of dinosaurs from mosquitoes that had been preserved in amber. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] However, the strands of DNA were incomplete, so DNA from frogs was used to fill in the gaps. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The dinosaurs were all cloned genetically as females in order to prevent breeding. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The group is then joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim Murphy (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello) for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees the trip from the park's control room. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] However, the tour does not go as planned, with most of the dinosaurs failing to appear and a Triceratops becoming ill. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] As a tropical storm approaches Isla Nublar, most of the park employees depart on a boat for the mainland and the visitors return to the electric tour vehicles, except Ellie, who stays with the park's veterinarian to study the Triceratops. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] During the storm, Jurassic Park's computer programmer, Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight), who has secretly been paid by a corporate rival to steal dinosaur embryos, deactivates the park's security system to allow him access to the embryo storage room.

The Salton Sea_2,"While playing the trumpet in a burning room, the protagonist's voice is heard in narration.
His story begins with him posing as ""Danny Parker"", a speed freak addicted to methamphetamine, who hangs out with friends while indulging in drugs.
He also moonlights as an informant for two corrupt cops, Gus Morgan (Doug Hutchison) and Al Garcetti (Anthony LaPaglia).
He is trying to set up a large meth score with notorious drug dealer Pooh Bear (D'Onofrio), an eccentric psychopath who lost his nose to excessive snorting of ""Gack"" (meth), while also attempting to set up a sting operation for Morgan and Garcetti.

When he returns home, Danny sheds his clothes and his personality, and basks in his past life as trumpet player ""Tom Van Allen"".
He reveals to an abused neighbor named Colette (Deborah Kara Unger) that he was once happily married, only to watch as his wife was gunned down by masked thieves during a stopover at the Salton Sea.

When meeting with Pooh Bear, Danny becomes fearful of Pooh Bear's displays of bizarre homicidal behavior, so he tapes a gun to the bottom of a table.

Danny's parents-in-law track him down, believing he has sunk into depression after his wife's death, but he tells them he doesn't want their help.
As the deal approaches, it becomes known that Danny is not only working for the police but FBI agents working to take down Morgan and Garcetti, who have committed multiple murders.
It is also revealed that they were the men who killed his wife and wounded him as they robbed a drug dealer.
Danny had started his own investigation when he found out who Morgan was and delved into the drug underworld to become a believable junkie.

On the night of the deal, Danny, with the help of his best friend Jimmy (Peter Sarsgaard), leads the FBI to the wrong location.
Meanwhile, Danny arrives at Pooh Bear's house.
At the dinner table, surrounded by Pooh Bear's armed friends, tensions rise and one of Pooh Bear's men tries to kill Danny, who retrieves the gun he stashed earlier and shoots the rest of the gang.
Shot in the chest by Pooh Bear, Danny collapses to the floor.

Pooh Bear, wounded in the leg, goes to take a shot of meth while mumbling incoherently.
Morgan and Garcetti arrive, find the massacre, and Garcetti kills Pooh Bear, whose drug-filled hypo drops to the floor.
Garcetti is then killed by Danny, whose life was saved by a bulletproof vest.
Morgan is shot twice by Danny, who reveals to Morgan that he knows he murdered his wife.
Morgan manages to snatch Danny's gun away, but finds it empty.
Danny finds Pooh Bear's syringe on the floor and plunges it into Morgan's neck, then picks up a pistol and briefly contemplates suicide, but then shoots Morgan several times and flees.

Back in his apartment, he dons his Tom Van Allen identity again, but is shot by Colette's ""boyfriend"" (Luis Guzman), who is actually a man Danny ratted out to the police.
Collette says she was forced to betray Danny because her daughter was being held hostage.
The room catches fire, and Danny plays one more tune on his trumpet before passing out.

He regains consciousness to find that Jimmy has saved him from the fire and taken him to a hospital.
After he recovers, he leaves the city, and the identities of Danny and Tom, behind.","[STR_SENT] While playing the trumpet in a burning room, the protagonist's voice is heard in narration.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011 film)_0,"In Stockholm, Sweden, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, co-owner of Millennium magazine, has just lost a libel case brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström.
Meanwhile, Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker, compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger, who has a special task for him.
In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström, Blomkvist agrees to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik's grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago.
After moving to the Vanger family's compound, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing a list of names and numbers that no one has been able to decipher.

Salander, who is under state legal guardianship due to diagnosed mental incompetency, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman, after her previous guardian has a stroke.
Bjurman abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and then violently rapes her not realizing she has a hidden video camera in her bag.
At their next meeting she stuns him with a Taser, anally rapes him with a dildo and marks him as a rapist with a tattoo on his chest and stomach.
Using her video recording she threatens blackmail, insisting that he write a glowing progress report and allow her full control of her money.

Blomkvist's daughter visits him and notes that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references.
Blomkvist tells Vanger's lawyer Dirch Frode that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander based on the work she did researching Blomkvist himself.
Blomkvist hires Salander to further investigate the notebook's content.
She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women that occurred from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites.
During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers.
Henrik's brother Harald identifies Martin, Harriet's brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, as a possible suspect.
Salander's research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, had committed the murders.

Blomkvist breaks into Martin's house to look for more clues, but Martin catches him and prepares to kill him.
Martin brags about having killed women for decades, but denies killing Harriet.
Salander arrives, subdues Martin and saves Blomkvist.
While Salander tends to Blomkvist, Martin flees.
Salander, on her motorcycle, pursues Martin in his SUV.
He loses control of his vehicle on an icy road and dies when it catches fire.
Salander nurses Blomkvist back to health, and tells him that she tried to kill her father when she was 12.
After recovering, Blomkvist deduces that Harriet is still alive and her cousin Anita likely knows where she is.
He and Salander monitor Anita, waiting for her to contact Harriet.
When nothing happens, Blomkvist confronts her, correctly deducing that Anita is Harriet herself.
She explains that her father and brother had sexually abused her for years, and that Martin saw her kill their father in self-defense.
Her cousin Anita smuggled her out of the island and let her live under her identity.
Finally free of her brother, she returns to Sweden and tearfully reunites with Henrik.

As promised, Henrik gives Blomkvist the information on Wennerström, but it proves to be worthless.
Salander hacks into Wennerström's computer and presents Blomkvist with damning evidence of Wennerström's crimes.
Blomkvist publishes an article which ruins Wennerström, who flees the country.
Salander hacks into Wennerström's bank accounts and, travelling to Switzerland in disguise, transfers two billion euros to various accounts.
Wennerström is soon found murdered.
Salander reveals to her former guardian that she is in love with Blomkvist.
On her way to give Blomkvist a Christmas present, however, Salander sees him and his longtime lover and business partner Erika Berger walking together happily.

Funny People_0,"George Simmons (Adam Sandler) is a very successful 40-something comedian and actor.
However, he is self-absorbed, lonely and estranged from his family.
When diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, George is offered an experimental treatment that has an eight-percent chance of therapeutic response.
Believing he is about to die, he decides to return to his roots and do stand-up comedy.
Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) is an aspiring stand-up comedian who shares an apartment with his two best friends in Los Angeles, Mark Taylor Jackson and Leo Koenig (Jason Schwartzman and Jonah Hill).
Mark stars in a fictional sitcom, Yo Teach, where he plays a teacher for a group of misfit students.
Despite the obvious failings of the show, Mark constantly brags about his high income.
When fellow stand-up comedienne Daisy Danby (Aubrey Plaza) visits the apartment, Mark magnanimously tells Ira that he will hold off having sex with her for ten days in order for Ira to make a play for her.
At a comedy club, George takes the stage to deliver a dark routine, which Ira mocks in his follow-on act.
George calls Ira the next morning and asks him to write jokes for George's upcoming gig at a MySpace corporate event.

George hires Ira as his assistant.
When George tells him about his condition, Ira cares for him through the treatment.
Ira implores George to tell people about his disease.
George previously had called his ex-fiancée, Laura (Leslie Mann), to apologize for his infidelities when they were together, but does not tell her why he is having a change of heart.
Meanwhile, Ira awkwardly asks Daisy out, but later discovers that she and Mark have slept together, and angrily cuts off all ties with her.
Laura learns about George's illness, visits him at his house, and confesses that her husband, Clarke (Eric Bana), cheats on her as well.
They reconcile and tentatively become friends.
George′s physician tells him that the leukemia is in remission.
George is happy but is unsure what to do with his life now.
He decides he wants a long-term relationship and calls Laura, but does not tell her the news.
George and Ira go to a gig in San Francisco, where Laura meets them there.
George makes Ira tell Laura during intermission that he is free of disease.
George later explains that he did not want to ""jinx it"".

Laura invites George and Ira to her house in Marin County.
George and Ira spend time with Laura and her two young daughters.
George and Laura sneak into the guest house together to have sex; meanwhile, Ira tells both daughters that George is healthy.
When Clarke unexpectedly arrives, Laura asks George to maintain the façade of being terminally ill.
In the morning, Clarke bids George a tearful goodbye — which is cut short when his daughters reveal that George is actually healthy now.
Clarke confronts Laura and accuses her of cheating.
In response, Laura confronts him with his infidelity, and he drives off in a huff.
Laura tells George that she plans to leave Clarke; George is overjoyed, but Ira tells him their affair will destroy a family.
Angered, George threatens to fire him.
The next day, George, Ira, and Laura watch the video of Laura′s oldest daughter, Mabel, performing the song ""Memory"" from the musical Cats; Ira and Laura find the performance moving, but George appears bored.
Laura leaves for the airport to tell Clarke she is leaving him; Ira lies to George and follows her.
At the airport, Clarke confesses his infidelity to Laura, and pleads with her to give their marriage another try.
Laura agrees and says her affair with George was a mere ""flirtation"".

We Own the Night (film)_2,"In Brooklyn, New York from November 1988 through early April 1989.
Bobby Green (Joaquin Phoenix) is the manager of a successful El Caribe nightclub in Brighton Beach that is frequented by Russian gangster and drug lord Vadim Nezhinski (Alex Veadov) and owned by Vadim's uncle and Bobby's boss, Marat Buzhayev.

Bobby has distanced himself from his father, NYPD Deputy Chief Burt Grusinsky (Robert Duvall), and his brother, Captain Joseph Grusinsky (Mark Wahlberg).
He has changed his last name to the maiden name of his mother, Carol Green, preferring to remain on the sidelines and enjoy a hedonistic life with his girlfriend Amada Juarez (Eva Mendes) and best friend Louis ""Jumbo"" Falsetti (Danny Hoch).

When police forces led by Joseph make a raid on Bobby's nightclub on November 22, 1988, hoping to net Vadim, Bobby refuses to cooperate.
The incident strains his relationship with his father and brother even more, to the point that he and Joseph exchange blows and insult each other's significant other (for Bobby, it is Amada, and for Joseph, it is his wife Sandra).

The police are unsuccessful in capturing Vadim, who decides to retaliate.
At 5:43 pm on the evening of November 23, 1988, Joseph is shot by a masked assailant, and his unmarked police cruiser firebombed.
Joseph survives the ambush, but the extent of the injury requires him to be hospitalized for four months.
Vadim, unaware of Bobby's family ties, confides that the Chief will be the next victim.
Bobby resolves to help the police.
Behind his father's back, Bobby goes undercover inside Vadim's drug-smuggling operation and has a narrow escape.
Bobby and Amada are placed under constant police protection and their relationship begins to deteriorate.

On March 20, 1989, Vadim escapes custody while being transported to a hospital.
The police prepare to move Bobby and Amada to a new location.
During a blinding thunderstorm, the police convoy is intercepted by Vadim's men and, during a chaotic car chase, Burt is fatally shot.
Bobby passes out in the rain when he sees his father's body.

The police take Bobby and Amada back to a Sheraton Hotel near Kennedy Airport.
He wakes up a few hours later and finds Joseph in the hotel room.
After Joseph tells him that their father died, Bobby cries in Joseph's arms and asks how ""they"" found them.
At the funeral, which is attended by all of the officers and their families, a colleague of Joseph's, Captain Jack Shapiro, gives him Burt's Korean War medal.
Bobby is told that a Russian shipment is coming in sometime in the next week.

To avenge his father, Bobby decides to officially join the police force without the consent of Amada, who leaves him.
After he is sworn into the NYPD, Bobby, now in uniform, learns the true involvement of Jumbo, his friend, and Marat, Vadim's uncle.
He and Joseph organize a final sting operation, set for April 4, 1989.
During the raid, Joseph is emotionally incapacitated by the memory of his shooting and cannot continue.
Vadim flees into the reed beds, and the police toss in flares to smoke him out.
As the beds are engulfed in flames and smoke, Bobby runs in to find Vadim himself, ignoring the other officers' pleas that he wait.
Bobby shoots Vadim in the chest, mortally wounding him.

The story ends on November 3, 1989, nearly a year after its beginning, with Bobby graduating from the NYPD Police Academy to become a full-time police officer, just in time for the 1990s.
Before the ceremony, Joseph reveals to Bobby that he has decided to switch to a job in the administration sector, since the shooting made him think about how much he needs to spend more time with his three children (in the beginning, he has only two).
As the chaplain announces that Bobby is to give the valedictory speech, Bobby thinks he sees Amada in the audience, but it turns out to be an illusion.
Bobby and Joseph express their brotherly love.","[STR_SENT] In Brooklyn, New York from November 1988 through early April 1989.

Bobby passes out in the rain when he sees his father's body.

The police take Bobby and Amada back to a Sheraton Hotel near Kennedy Airport.
He wakes up a few hours later and finds Joseph in the hotel room.
After Joseph tells him that their father died, Bobby cries in Joseph's arms and asks how ""they"" found them.
At the funeral, which is attended by all of the officers and their families, a colleague of Joseph's, Captain Jack Shapiro, gives him Burt's Korean War medal.
Bobby is told that a Russian shipment is coming in sometime in the next week.

To avenge his father, Bobby decides to officially join the police force without the consent of Amada, who leaves him.
After he is sworn into the NYPD, Bobby, now in uniform, learns the true involvement of Jumbo, his friend, and Marat, Vadim's uncle.
He and Joseph organize a final sting operation, set for April 4, 1989.
During the raid, Joseph is emotionally incapacitated by the memory of his shooting and cannot continue.
Vadim flees into the reed beds, and the police toss in flares to smoke him out.
As the beds are engulfed in flames and smoke, Bobby runs in to find Vadim himself, ignoring the other officers' pleas that he wait.
Bobby shoots Vadim in the chest, mortally wounding him.

The story ends on November 3, 1989, nearly a year after its beginning, with Bobby graduating from the NYPD Police Academy to become a full-time police officer, just in time for the 1990s.
Before the ceremony, Joseph reveals to Bobby that he has decided to switch to a job in the administration sector, since the shooting made him think about how much he needs to spend more time with his three children (in the beginning, he has only two).

Alien Nation (film)_0,"The year is 1991, and it has been three years since an immense lost and off-course extraterrestrial saucer bearing 300,000 enslaved aliens, the Newcomers, landed in the Mojave Desert on planet Earth.
Los Angeles becomes a new home for the aliens who take, or in some cases are assigned, renowned human names such as Harley Davidson and Humphrey Bogart.
However, among humans the aliens are discriminated against, and referred to in derogatory terms such as the word 'Slag' , or the ghettos which they reside in as 'Slagtown' .
Matthew Sykes (Caan) is a Los Angeles police detective who loses his partner Bill Tuggle (Brown) in a criminal shoot-out.
The detectives were trying to stop two Newcomer felons murdering another Newcomer named Cecil Porter (Parton), behind a cash register in a small mini-mart in what appeared to be a robbery; the Newcomer robbers are using high-powered weapons using sabot rounds, one of which kills Tuggle even through the vehicle he is using for cover.

The next day, Sykes' superior Captain Warner (McCarthy), informs his squad that they will have to work with the newly promoted Newcomer detective Sam Francisco (Patinkin), and that if nobody volunteers, he will choose someone to carry out those duties.
Although having racist opinions about ""Slags"", Sykes enlists to work with Francisco to investigate a similar homicide with a Newcomer named Warren Hubely; feeling that if he investigates that crime, he will also find opportunities to investigate his partner's death which he is officially forbidden to do.
Meanwhile, Warner assigns the robbery murder case to detectives Fedorchuk (Jason) and Alterez (Perez).
Showing no faith in their ability to find the truth, Sykes requisitions a powerful .454 Casull revolver for a sidearm to be more effective dealing with Newcomers.

As the troubled pair continue with the Hubely-homicide probe; Sykes discovers similarities between their case and the robbery, while at a crime lab, Francisco detects an abnormality on the body of one of the Newcomer criminals who was killed in the robbery with pathologist Mr. Winter (Young).
Following an interview with a Newcomer named Trent Porter (Thompson), who is also the son of the innocent Newcomer fatality during the robbery; Sykes and Francisco are led to a nightclub called Encounters to investigate a link in the homicides with a Newcomer named Joshua Strader (Kober).
However, they end up interviewing his girlfriend Cassandra (Bevis) instead, after he is murdered by a criminal ring led by Newcomer businessman William Harcourt (Stamp) and his henchman Rudyard Kipling (Howard).

Harcourt is in the latter stages of launching advanced plans to exploit the alien race by attempting to mass-produce and sell a drug called Jabroka.
The drug was used in the past to pacify the Newcomers when they were slaves, but has no effect on humans.
The abnormality noticed by Francisco on the body of the Newcomer criminal earlier, was a visual sign of the drug's influence.
In addition, the Newcomers Hubley, Porter and Strader were involved in the planning phases of the operation, but were later murdered due to Harcourt's desire to exclude them from any future financial rewards.
Ultimately, Sykes and Francisco track down Harcourt to the Encounters club, where he is secretly negotiating a timetable for the release of his potent narcotic.
The detectives attempt to foil his plans, as they are later led on a car chase with Harcourt and his cohort Kipling, through the streets of downtown Los Angeles.
Following a head-on automobile collision where Francisco is injured and Kipling subsequently killed, Sykes on foot, corners Harcourt onto a desolate drawbridge.
Harcourt then purposely overdoses on a sample of the controlled-substance he was illegally trying to distribute to the Newcomers.

As Sykes mistakenly believes he died, Harcourt is taken away by an ambulance, but later mutates into a significantly larger and more muscular Newcomer intent on causing violence.
After Francisco discovers Sykes' misstep, the duo pursue Harcourt.
Catching up with Harcourt near a fishing pier, Sykes leads him onto the deck of a fishing trawler.
The pair then end up in a physical confrontation in the open sea.
Harcourt dies, as his body disintegrates due to the effects of direct contact with salt water, which is hazardous towards Newcomer physiology.
Francisco commandeers a police helicopter, forcing himself to pull Sykes from the water even as it burns the flesh of his arm.
With the Tuggle and Newcomer murder cases solved, the authorities dismantle Harcourt's illicit scheme involved in trying to subdue the aliens, and Sykes invites Francisco to his daughter's wedding, pausing to apologize in advance for all the hateful things he knows he will say.
Francisco accepts, telling him, ""After all...you are only human.""","[STR_SENT] The year is 1991, and it has been three years since an immense lost and off-course extraterrestrial saucer bearing 300,000 enslaved aliens, the Newcomers, landed in the Mojave Desert on planet Earth.

The Hangover_0,"Celebrating his upcoming marriage to Tracy Garner (Sasha Barrese), Doug Billings (Justin Bartha) travels with his best friends Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper), Stu Price (Ed Helms), and Tracy's brother and Doug's future brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galifianakis) to Las Vegas in Alan's father's Mercedes-Benz for a bachelor party, staying at Caesars Palace, where they relax in the room and go to a casino and celebrate with few drinks on the hotel rooftop.
The next morning, Phil, Stu and Alan awaken to find they have no memory of the previous night, and Doug is nowhere to be found.
Stu is missing a tooth, their hotel suite is in disarray, a tiger is in their bathroom, a chicken in their living room, and a baby is in the closet, whom they name ""Carlos"".
They find Doug's mattress impaled on a statue outside of their hotel and when they ask for their Mercedes, the valet delivers an LVPD police cruiser.

Following clues to their steps, the trio travel to a hospital where they discover they were drugged with rohypnol (""roofies""), causing their memory loss, and that they came to the hospital from a chapel.
At the chapel, they learn that Stu married a stripper, Jade (Heather Graham), despite having a long-term relationship with his mean-spirited girlfriend, Melissa (Rachael Harris).
Outside the chapel, the trio are attacked by gangsters, saying they are looking for someone.
They flee and visit Jade, discovering that she is the mother of the baby, whose real name is Tyler, before being arrested by the police for stealing the police cruiser.
Having been told that the Mercedes has been impounded, the trio is released when they volunteer to be targets for a taser demonstration, unknowingly.
While driving the Mercedes, they discover a naked Chinese guy in the trunk who attacks them and flees.
Alan confesses that he drugged their drinks to ensure they had a good night, thinking the drug to be ecstasy.

Returning to their villa, they find Mike Tyson, who orders the trio to return the tiger to his mansion immediately.
Stu drugs the tiger with the remaining rohypnol and they drive towards Tyson's home in the Mercedes, but the tiger attacks them, claws Phil on his neck, and damages the car's interior.
After pushing the car the rest of the way to the mansion, Tyson shows the trio footage of them at his house to help them locate Doug.
While driving, their car is struck by another vehicle intentionally; the passengers are revealed to be the gangsters from the chapel and their boss, Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) – the naked man from their trunk – who accuses the trio of stealing $80,000 of his money that was in his purse and kidnapping him.
As the guys try to deny this, Chow says he has their friend, and threatens to kill him if his money is not returned.
Unaware of the location of Chow's $80,000, Alan, with help from Stu and Jade, uses his knowledge of card counting to win $82,400 playing Blackjack.

They meet with Chow and exchange the money, only to find that ""Doug"" is an African-American drug dealer (nicknamed Black Doug by the trio), who inadvertently sold Alan the roofies.
With the wedding occurring in 5 hours, Phil phones Tracy, telling her that they cannot find Doug.
After a conversation with ""Black Doug"" (Mike Epps), Stu realizes where Doug is.
The trio travel back to their hotel where they find Doug on the roof, moved there on his mattress while he was asleep, as a practical joke by Stu, Phil and Alan.
Doug's mattress had been thrown there by Doug himself, in an attempt to signal for help.
Before leaving, Stu makes arrangements to go on a date with Jade the following week.
With less than four hours before the wedding and with no flights to L.A. available, the foursome race home, with Doug revealing he has possession of Chow's original $80,000.
Despite their late arrival, Doug and Tracy are married and Stu breaks up with Melissa after having grown tired of her controlling his life.
As the reception ends, Alan finds Stu's digital camera detailing the events they cannot remember and the four agree to look at the pictures together before deleting the evidence of their exploits.","[STR_SENT] Celebrating his upcoming marriage to Tracy Garner (Sasha Barrese), Doug Billings (Justin Bartha) travels with his best friends Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper), Stu Price (Ed Helms), and Tracy's brother and Doug's future brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galifianakis) to Las Vegas in Alan's father's Mercedes-Benz for a bachelor party, staying at Caesars Palace, where they relax in the room and go to a casino and celebrate with few drinks on the hotel rooftop.

Terminator Salvation_0,"In 2003, Doctor Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) of Cyberdyne Systems convinces death row inmate Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) to sign his body over for medical research following his execution.
One year later the Skynet system is activated, perceives humans as a threat and eradicates much of humanity in the ""Judgment Day"" event (depicted in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines).

In 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale) leads a Resistance attack on a Skynet base.
John discovers human prisoners and schematics for a new type of Terminator, incorporating living tissue.
He is the only survivor of the assault after the base is destroyed in a nuclear explosion.
Much later, though, Marcus emerges from the base's wreckage and starts walking towards Los Angeles.

John returns to Resistance headquarters, located aboard a nuclear submarine, and tells General Ashdown (Michael Ironside) of his findings.
Meanwhile, the Resistance has discovered a radio signal believed to send an order to shut down Skynet machines.
They plan to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco in four days, in response to an intercepted ""kill list"" created by Skynet with a plan to kill the Resistance's command staff.
John learns he is second on the list, following Kyle Reese.
The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyle's importance, but John knows Kyle will eventually go back in time and become his father (The Terminator).
John meets with his wife Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard) and second in command Barnes (Common).
He transmits a radio broadcast to Resistance members and surviving civilians around the world.

Arriving in the ruins of Los Angeles, Marcus is saved from a T-600 Terminator by Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and the mute child Star (Jadagrace Berry).
Kyle updates Marcus about the war between humans and Skynet.
Hearing John's radio broadcast, the three leave in search of the Resistance.
They survive an attack at a gas station, but Kyle, Star, and several other humans are taken prisoner.

Two Resistance A-10 airplanes are shot down when they try to intercept the machine transport and its escorts.
Marcus locates downed pilot Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood) and they make their way to John's base, where Marcus is wounded by a magnetic land mine.
Attempting to save his life, the Resistance fighters discover that he is a cyborg, with a mechanical endoskeleton and a partially artificial cerebral cortex.
Marcus believes himself to be human, but John thinks that Marcus has been sent to kill him, and orders his destruction.
However, Blair helps Marcus escape.
During the pursuit, Marcus saves John's life from Skynet hydrobots, and the two make a bargain: Marcus will enter Skynet's headquarters and attempt to help John rescue Kyle and the other prisoners.

John pleads with Ashdown to delay the attack, but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command.
However, the Resistance forces disobey Ashdown's orders and await John's signal.
Marcus enters the base, interfaces with the computer, and disables the perimeter defenses so that John can infiltrate the cell block and release the human prisoners.
Marcus discovers that he was created by Skynet in order to lure John to the base; when the Resistance launches its attack, John will be killed, achieving the goal that Skynet had failed to accomplish so many times.
The radio signal that the Resistance's plan depends on is a ruse, and Skynet uses the signal to track down and destroy the command submarine with the Resistance leaders aboard.

Marcus tears out the hardware linking him to Skynet and assists John in battling a new T-800 model 101 Terminator.
John is mortally wounded during the fight, but succeeds in destroying the Skynet base by rigging several Terminator fuel cells to explode, detonating them as he, Marcus, Kyle, and Star are airlifted out.
Kate attempts to save John's life, but his heart is too badly damaged.
Marcus offers his own heart for transplant, sacrificing himself to save John.
Recovering, John radios to the other Resistance fighters that though this battle has been won, the war is far from over.","[STR_SENT] In 2003, Doctor Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) of Cyberdyne Systems convinces death row inmate Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) to sign his body over for medical research following his execution.

Young Frankenstein_1,"Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) is a physician lecturer at an American medical school and engaged to the tightly wound actress Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn).
He becomes exasperated when anyone brings up the subject of his grandfather, the infamous mad scientist.
To disassociate himself from his legacy, Frederick insists that his surname be pronounced ""Fronk-en-steen.""

When a solicitor informs him that he has inherited his family's estate in Transylvania after the death of his great grandfather, the Baron Beauvort von Frankenstein, Frederick travels to Europe to inspect the property.
At the Transylvania train station, he is met by a hunchbacked, bulging-eyed servant named Igor, pronounced as ""eye-gore"" (Marty Feldman), and a lovely young personal assistant named Inga (Teri Garr).
Upon arrival at the estate, Frederick meets the forbidding housekeeper Frau Blücher (Cloris Leachman), whose name causes horses to rear up and neigh madly in fright.
Though his family legacy has brought shame and ridicule, Frederick becomes increasingly intrigued about his grandfather's work, especially after Inga assists him in discovering the secret entrance to his grandfather's laboratory.
Upon reading his grandfather's private journals, Frederick is so transformed that he decides to resume his grandfather's experiments in re-animating the dead.
He and Igor resort to robbing the grave of a recently executed criminal, and Frederick sets to work experimenting on the large corpse.
Matters go awry, however, when Igor is sent to steal the brain of a deceased revered scientist, Hans Delbruck; startled by lightning, he drops and ruins Delbruck's brain.
Taking a second brain, Igor returns with a brain labeled ""Do Not Use This Brain!
Abnormal"" (which he subsequently refers to as ""A-b (Abby) Normal""), which Frederick unknowingly transplants into the corpse.

Soon, Frederick is ready to re-animate his creature (Peter Boyle), who is elevated on a platform to the roof of the laboratory during a lightning storm.
Eventually, electrical charges bring the creature to life.
The creature makes its first halting steps, but, frightened by Igor lighting a match, attacks Frederick and must be sedated.
Upon being asked whose brain was obtained, Igor confesses that he supplied ""Abby Normal's"" (abnormal) brain, unknowingly creating the Monster.

The townspeople are uneasy at the possibility of Frederick continuing his grandfather's work.
Most concerned is Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars), a police official who sports an eyepatch and monocle over the same eye, a creaky, disjointed wooden arm, and an accent so comically thick even his own countrymen cannot understand him.
Kemp visits the doctor and subsequently demands assurance that he will not create another monster.
Upon returning to the lab, Frederick discovers that Frau Blücher is setting the creature free.
After she reveals the monster's love of violin music, and her own romantic relationship with Frederick's grandfather, the creature is enraged by sparks from a thrown switch, and escapes from the Frankenstein castle.

While roaming the countryside, the Monster has frustrating encounters with a young girl and a blind hermit (Gene Hackman); these scenes directly parody the original Frankenstein movies.
Frederick recaptures the monster and locks the two of them in a room, where he calms the monster's homicidal tendencies with flattery and fully acknowledges his own heritage, shouting out emphatically, ""My name is Frankenstein!""
(This time, he uses the more common, Anglicized pronunciation.)

Frederick offers the sight of ""The Creature"" following simple commands to a theater full of illustrious guests.
The demonstration continues with Frederick and the monster launching into the musical number ""Puttin' on the Ritz,"" complete with top hats and tails.
Although the monster can only shout his song lines in painfully high-pitched monotones, he dances impressively with almost perfect timing.
The routine ends disastrously, however, when a stage light explodes and frightens the monster, who becomes enraged, pushes Frederick, and charges into the audience, where he is captured and chained by police.

The monster escapes, then kidnaps and ravishes the not unwilling Elizabeth when she arrives unexpectedly for a visit.
Elizabeth falls in love with the creature due to his inhuman stamina and his enormous penis (referred to as Schwanstuker or Schwanzstück — a Yiddish word from Schwanz, ""tail,"" which also is German slang for ""penis,"" and Stück, ""piece"").

The townspeople hunt for the monster.
Desperate to get the creature back, Frederick plays the violin to lure his creation back to the castle.
Just as the Kemp-led mob storms the laboratory, Frankenstein transfers some of his stabilizing intellect to the creature who, as a result, is able to reason with and placate the mob.
The film ends happily, with Elizabeth married to the now erudite and sophisticated monster--with her hair styled identically to that of the female creature from The Bride Of Frankenstein, while Inga joyfully learns what her new husband Frederick got in return during the transfer procedure--the monster's Schwanzstück.","[STR_SENT] Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) is a physician lecturer at an American medical school and engaged to the tightly wound actress Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn).

The Sting_1,"The film takes place in 1936, at the height of the Great Depression.
Johnny Hooker, a grifter in Joliet, Illinois, cons $11,000 in cash from an unsuspecting victim with the aid of his partners Luther Coleman and Joe Erie.
Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago to teach him ""the big con"".
Unfortunately, their victim was a numbers racket courier for vicious crime boss Doyle Lonnegan.
Corrupt Joliet police Lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing Lonnegan's involvement and demanding part of Hooker’s cut.
Having already spent his share, Hooker pays Snyder in counterfeit bills.
Lonnegan's men murder Luther, and Hooker flees for his life to Chicago.

Hooker finds Henry Gondorff, a once-great con-man now hiding from the FBI, and asks for his help in taking on the dangerous Lonnegan.
Gondorff is initially reluctant, but he relents and decides to resurrect an elaborate and supposedly obsolete scam known as ""the wire"", using a crew of con artists to create a phony off-track betting parlor.

Aboard the opulent 20th Century Limited, Gondorff, posing as boorish Chicago bookie Shaw, buys into Lonnegan's private, high-stakes poker game.
Shaw infuriates Lonnegan with his obnoxious behavior, then out-cheats him to win $15,000.
Hooker, posing as Shaw's disgruntled employee, Kelly, is sent to collect the winnings and instead convinces Lonnegan that he wants to take over Shaw's operation.
""Kelly"" reveals that he has a partner named Les Harmon (actually con man Kid Twist) in the Chicago Western Union office, who will allow them to win bets on horse races by past-posting.

Meanwhile, Snyder has tracked Hooker to Chicago, but his pursuit is thwarted when he is summoned by undercover FBI agents led by Agent Polk, who orders him to assist in their plan to arrest Gondorff using Hooker.
At the same time, Lonnegan has grown frustrated with his men's inability to find and kill Hooker.
Unaware that Kelly is Hooker, he demands that Salino, his best assassin, be given the job.
A mysterious figure with black leather gloves is then seen following and observing Hooker.

Kelly's connection appears effective, as Harmon provides Lonnegan with the winner of one horse race and the trifecta of another race.
Lonnegan agrees to finance a $500,000 bet at Shaw's parlor to break Shaw and gain revenge.
Shortly thereafter, Snyder captures Hooker and brings him before FBI Agent Polk.
Polk forces Hooker to betray Gondorff by threatening to incarcerate Luther Coleman's widow.

The night before the sting, Hooker sleeps with Loretta, a waitress from a local restaurant.
As Hooker leaves the building the next morning, he sees Loretta walking toward him.
The black-gloved man appears behind Hooker and shoots her dead – she was Lonnegan's hired killer, Loretta Salino, and the shooter was hired by Gondorff to protect Hooker.

Armed with Harmon’s tip to ""place it on Lucky Dan"", Lonnegan makes the $500,000 bet at Shaw’s parlor on Lucky Dan to win.
As the race begins, Harmon arrives and expresses shock at Lonnegan's bet, explaining that when he said ""place it"" he meant, literally, that Lucky Dan would ""place"" (i.e., finish second).
In a panic, Lonnegan rushes the teller window and demands his money back.
As this happens, Agent Polk, Lt. Snyder, and a half dozen FBI officers storm the parlor.
Polk confronts Gondorff, then tells Hooker he is free to go.
Gondorff, reacting to the betrayal, shoots Hooker in the back.
Polk then shoots Gondorff and orders Snyder to get the ostensibly respectable Lonnegan away from the crime scene.
With Lonnegan and Snyder safely away, Hooker and Gondorff rise amid cheers and laughter.
Agent Polk is actually Hickey, a con man, running a con atop Gondorff's con to divert Snyder and provide a solid ""blow off"".
As the con men strip the room of its contents, Hooker refuses his share of the money, saying ""I'd only blow it"", and walks away with Gondorff.","[STR_SENT] The film takes place in 1936, at the height of the Great Depression.

Kelly's connection appears effective, as Harmon provides Lonnegan with the winner of one horse race and the trifecta of another race.
Lonnegan agrees to finance a $500,000 bet at Shaw's parlor to break Shaw and gain revenge.
Shortly thereafter, Snyder captures Hooker and brings him before FBI Agent Polk.
Polk forces Hooker to betray Gondorff by threatening to incarcerate Luther Coleman's widow.

The night before the sting, Hooker sleeps with Loretta, a waitress from a local restaurant.
As Hooker leaves the building the next morning, he sees Loretta walking toward him.
The black-gloved man appears behind Hooker and shoots her dead – she was Lonnegan's hired killer, Loretta Salino, and the shooter was hired by Gondorff to protect Hooker.

Armed with Harmon’s tip to ""place it on Lucky Dan"", Lonnegan makes the $500,000 bet at Shaw’s parlor on Lucky Dan to win.
As the race begins, Harmon arrives and expresses shock at Lonnegan's bet, explaining that when he said ""place it"" he meant, literally, that Lucky Dan would ""place"" (i.e., finish second).
In a panic, Lonnegan rushes the teller window and demands his money back.
As this happens, Agent Polk, Lt. Snyder, and a half dozen FBI officers storm the parlor.
Polk confronts Gondorff, then tells Hooker he is free to go.
Gondorff, reacting to the betrayal, shoots Hooker in the back.
Polk then shoots Gondorff and orders Snyder to get the ostensibly respectable Lonnegan away from the crime scene.
With Lonnegan and Snyder safely away, Hooker and Gondorff rise amid cheers and laughter.
Agent Polk is actually Hickey, a con man, running a con atop Gondorff's con to divert Snyder and provide a solid ""blow off"".
As the con men strip the room of its contents, Hooker refuses his share of the money, saying ""I'd only blow it"", and walks away with Gondorff.","[STR_SENT] The film takes place in 1936, at the height of the Great Depression. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Johnny Hooker, a grifter in Joliet, Illinois, cons $11,000 in cash from an unsuspecting victim with the aid of his partners Luther Coleman and Joe Erie. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago to teach him ""the big con"". [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Unfortunately, their victim was a numbers racket courier for vicious crime boss Doyle Lonnegan.

Young Frankenstein_2,"Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) is a physician lecturer at an American medical school and engaged to the tightly wound actress Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn).
He becomes exasperated when anyone brings up the subject of his grandfather, the infamous mad scientist.
To disassociate himself from his legacy, Frederick insists that his surname be pronounced ""Fronk-en-steen.""

When a solicitor informs him that he has inherited his family's estate in Transylvania after the death of his great grandfather, the Baron Beauvort von Frankenstein, Frederick travels to Europe to inspect the property.
At the Transylvania train station, he is met by a hunchbacked, bulging-eyed servant named Igor, pronounced as ""eye-gore"" (Marty Feldman), and a lovely young personal assistant named Inga (Teri Garr).
Upon arrival at the estate, Frederick meets the forbidding housekeeper Frau Blücher (Cloris Leachman), whose name causes horses to rear up and neigh madly in fright.
Though his family legacy has brought shame and ridicule, Frederick becomes increasingly intrigued about his grandfather's work, especially after Inga assists him in discovering the secret entrance to his grandfather's laboratory.
Upon reading his grandfather's private journals, Frederick is so transformed that he decides to resume his grandfather's experiments in re-animating the dead.
He and Igor resort to robbing the grave of a recently executed criminal, and Frederick sets to work experimenting on the large corpse.
Matters go awry, however, when Igor is sent to steal the brain of a deceased revered scientist, Hans Delbruck; startled by lightning, he drops and ruins Delbruck's brain.
Taking a second brain, Igor returns with a brain labeled ""Do Not Use This Brain!
Abnormal"" (which he subsequently refers to as ""A-b (Abby) Normal""), which Frederick unknowingly transplants into the corpse.

Soon, Frederick is ready to re-animate his creature (Peter Boyle), who is elevated on a platform to the roof of the laboratory during a lightning storm.
Eventually, electrical charges bring the creature to life.
The creature makes its first halting steps, but, frightened by Igor lighting a match, attacks Frederick and must be sedated.
Upon being asked whose brain was obtained, Igor confesses that he supplied ""Abby Normal's"" (abnormal) brain, unknowingly creating the Monster.

The townspeople are uneasy at the possibility of Frederick continuing his grandfather's work.
Most concerned is Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars), a police official who sports an eyepatch and monocle over the same eye, a creaky, disjointed wooden arm, and an accent so comically thick even his own countrymen cannot understand him.
Kemp visits the doctor and subsequently demands assurance that he will not create another monster.
Upon returning to the lab, Frederick discovers that Frau Blücher is setting the creature free.
After she reveals the monster's love of violin music, and her own romantic relationship with Frederick's grandfather, the creature is enraged by sparks from a thrown switch, and escapes from the Frankenstein castle.

While roaming the countryside, the Monster has frustrating encounters with a young girl and a blind hermit (Gene Hackman); these scenes directly parody the original Frankenstein movies.
Frederick recaptures the monster and locks the two of them in a room, where he calms the monster's homicidal tendencies with flattery and fully acknowledges his own heritage, shouting out emphatically, ""My name is Frankenstein!""
(This time, he uses the more common, Anglicized pronunciation.)

Frederick offers the sight of ""The Creature"" following simple commands to a theater full of illustrious guests.
The demonstration continues with Frederick and the monster launching into the musical number ""Puttin' on the Ritz,"" complete with top hats and tails.
Although the monster can only shout his song lines in painfully high-pitched monotones, he dances impressively with almost perfect timing.
The routine ends disastrously, however, when a stage light explodes and frightens the monster, who becomes enraged, pushes Frederick, and charges into the audience, where he is captured and chained by police.

The monster escapes, then kidnaps and ravishes the not unwilling Elizabeth when she arrives unexpectedly for a visit.
Elizabeth falls in love with the creature due to his inhuman stamina and his enormous penis (referred to as Schwanstuker or Schwanzstück — a Yiddish word from Schwanz, ""tail,"" which also is German slang for ""penis,"" and Stück, ""piece"").

The townspeople hunt for the monster.
Desperate to get the creature back, Frederick plays the violin to lure his creation back to the castle.
Just as the Kemp-led mob storms the laboratory, Frankenstein transfers some of his stabilizing intellect to the creature who, as a result, is able to reason with and placate the mob.
The film ends happily, with Elizabeth married to the now erudite and sophisticated monster--with her hair styled identically to that of the female creature from The Bride Of Frankenstein, while Inga joyfully learns what her new husband Frederick got in return during the transfer procedure--the monster's Schwanzstück.","[STR_SENT] Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) is a physician lecturer at an American medical school and engaged to the tightly wound actress Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn).

Gran Torino_0,"Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a cantankerous, retired Polish American assembly line worker and Korean War veteran, who has recently been widowed after 50 years of marriage.
His Highland Park, Michigan neighborhood in the Detroit area, formerly populated by working-class white families, is now dominated by poor Asian immigrants, and gang violence is commonplace.
Adding to the isolation he feels is the emotional detachment of his family.

He rejects a suggestion from one of his sons to move to a retirement community (sensing they want his home and possessions), and lives alone with his elderly dog, Daisy.
A chronic smoker, Walt suffers from coughing fits, occasionally coughing up blood, but conceals this from his family.
Catholic priest Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) tries to comfort him, but Walt disdains the young, inexperienced man.

The Hmong Vang Lor family reside next door to Walt.
Initially, he wants nothing to do with his new neighbors, particularly after he catches Thao (Bee Vang), a member of that family, attempting to steal his Ford Gran Torino as a coerced initiation into a Hmong gang run by Thao's cousin, ""Spider"".
The gang is infuriated by Thao's failure and they attack him, but Walt confronts them with an M1 Garand rifle and chases them off, earning the respect of the Hmong community.

As penance, Thao's mother makes him work for Walt, who has him do odd jobs around the neighborhood, and the two form a grudging mutual respect.
Thao's sister Sue (Ahney Her) introduces Walt to Hmong culture and helps him bond with the Hmong community.
Walt helps Thao get a job and gives him dating advice.

Spider's gang continues to pressure Thao, assaulting him on his way home from work.
After he sees Thao's injuries, Walt visits the gang's house, where he attacks a gang member as a warning.
In retaliation, the gang performs a drive-by shooting on the Vang Lor home, injuring Thao, and kidnapping and raping Sue.
There are no witnesses and the members of the community, including the victims, refuse to talk about the crimes; preventing police from doing anything about Spider's gang.

The next day, Thao seeks Walt's help to exact revenge, who tells him to return later in the afternoon.
In the meantime, Walt makes personal preparations: he buys a suit, gets a haircut, and makes a confession to Father Janovich.
When Thao returns, Walt takes him to the basement and gives him his Silver Star; Walt then locks Thao in his basement and tells him that he has been haunted by the memory of killing an enemy soldier who was trying to surrender, something he had not confessed to Janovich.
He insists that Thao must never be haunted by killing another man, especially with his life ahead of him.

That night Walt goes to the house of the gang members, where they draw their weapons on him.
He speaks loudly, berating them and enumerating their crimes and thus drawing the attention of the neighbors.
Putting a cigarette in his mouth, he asks for a light; he then puts his hand in his jacket and provocatively pulls it out as if he were holding a gun, inciting the gang members to shoot and kill him.
As he falls to the ground, his hand opens to reveal the Zippo lighter with First Cavalry insignia he has used throughout the film: he was unarmed.
Sue, following Walt's directions earlier, frees Thao, and they drive to the scene in Walt's Gran Torino.
A Hmong police officer tells them the gang members have been arrested for murder and the surrounding neighbors have all come forward as witnesses.

Walt's funeral Mass is celebrated by Father Janovich and attended by his family and many of the Hmong community.
Afterward his last will and testament is read, where to the surprise of his family Walt leaves them nothing: his house goes to the church and his cherished Gran Torino goes to Thao, with the condition that Thao doesn't modify it.

Ring (film)_0,"Two teenagers, Masami (Hitomi Satō) and Tomoko (Yūko Takeuchi), talk about a videotape recorded by a boy in Izu, which is fabled to bear a curse that kills the viewer seven days after watching.
Tomoko then reveals that a week ago, she and three of her friends watched a weird tape and received a call after watching it.
Unnervingly similar to the storied videotape, Masami realizes that Tomoko was fated to die.
After some unsettling moments, Tomoko is killed by an unseen force with Masami having the horror of watching.

Some days later, Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima), a reporter investigating the popularity of the video curse among teenagers, discovers that her niece, Tomoko and her three other friends mysteriously died at the same time on the same night with their faces twisted in a rictus of fear.
She also discovers that Masami, the girl who was with Tomoko when she died, became insane and is now in a mental hospital.
After stumbling upon Tomoko's photos from the past week, Reiko finds out that the four teenagers stayed in a rental cabin in Izu.
Eventually, she flips to a photo of the teens with their faces blurred and distorted.

Later, Reiko goes to Izu and finds an unlabeled tape in the reception room of the rental cottage where the teenagers stayed.
Watching the tape inside Cabin B4, Reiko sees a series of seemingly unrelated disturbing images.
As soon as the tape is over, Reiko sees a reflection in the television, and as she turns to see nobody behind her she receives a phone call, a realization of the tell-tale videotape curse.
She now assumes that she has a week to live.

On the first day, Reiko enlists the help of her ex-husband, Ryūji Takayama (Hiroyuki Sanada).
They take a picture of Reiko and find her face blurred in the photograph, further confirming that Reiko really is cursed.
Ryūji then watches the tape, against Reiko's objections.
A day later, Reiko creates a copy for Ryūji for them to study.
They find a hidden message embedded within the tape saying that ""frolic in brine, goblins be thine"".
The message is in a form of dialect from Izu Ōshima Island.
That night, Reiko catches her young son Yoichi watching the videotape; he claims that Tomoko had told him to do it.
Reiko and Ryūji sail for Ōshima and discover the history of the great psychic Shizuko Yamamura, who was accused of faking supernatural powers; Yamamura committed suicide because of this.

With only a day left, Reiko and Ryūji discover that the videotape was made psionically by Shizuko's lost daughter, Sadako Yamamura, whose supernatural powers surpassed even those of her mother.
The two go back to Izu with the assumption that Sadako is dead and it was her vengeful spirit (Onryō) that killed the teenagers.
The duo then uncover a well under Cabin B4 and realize, through a vision, that Sadako's father killed her and threw her into the well.
They try to empty the well and find Sadako's body in an attempt to appease her spirit.
Minutes before her seven days are up, Reiko finally finds Sadako's corpse at the bottom.
When nothing happens to Reiko, they believe that the curse is broken.

All seems fine until the next day when Ryūji is at his home and his TV switches on by itself, showing the image of a well.
He stares in horror as the ghost of Sadako crawls out of the well and out of Ryūji's TV set and frightens him into a state of shock, therefore killing him via cardiac arrest.
Before dying, he manages to dial Reiko's number; she hears his last minutes over the phone and realizes the videotape's curse remains unbroken.
Desperate to find a cure to save her son, Reiko realized that what she had done—and that Ryūji had not—saved her: copying the tape and showing it to someone else.
With a VCR and Ryūji's copy of the tape, Reiko travels with her son to see her father in an attempt to save him, realizing that this is a never-ending cycle: The tape must always be copied and passed on to ensure the survival of the viewers.","[STR_SENT] Two teenagers, Masami (Hitomi Satō) and Tomoko (Yūko Takeuchi), talk about a videotape recorded by a boy in Izu, which is fabled to bear a curse that kills the viewer seven days after watching.

The Exorcist (film)_0,"In Northern Iraq during an archeological dig, archeologist and priest Father Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow) discovers a small amulet, and after studying it discovers it resembles a statue of Pazuzu, a monstrous demon in the form of a man, falcon, serpent and lion.
Merrin suspects Pazuzu, whom he defeated many years ago, will return.

In Georgetown, Washington D.C., actress Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) begins noticing strange and frightening behavioral changes in her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) such as constant swearing and abnormal strength.
When medicine fails, Regan is given a few unpleasant tests, but X-ray results prove ""negative"" much to the confusion of the doctors.
In reality, Regan is now possessed because of a Ouija board by Pazuzu, who pretended to be her imaginary friend ""Captain Howdy.""

Burke Dennings (Jack McGowran), Chris's British director, dies mysteriously after falling from Regan's open bedroom window while Chris' secretary Sharon Spencer (Kitty Winn) was out.
His murder is investigated by detective William Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb), who questions both Chris and a young priest named Damien Karras (Jason Miller) who has lost faith in God after the death of his ill and elderly Greek mother, with only Chris suspecting Regan.
After Regan assaults a psychiatrist, the doctors finally decide an exorcism may be Regan's only hope.
Chris, however, is tentative as she and Regan have no religious beliefs.

Karras agrees to see Regan for Chris but refuses to perform an exorcism; however, further supernatural phenomena force him to accept Regan needs an exorcism.
Karras is given permission by the bishop, who, at the request of the university's president, also hires Merrin to help, since he has prior experience with exorcisms.

Working together, Karras and Merrin attempt to exorcise Pazuzu from Regan, but the demon taunts them, especially Karras for his weak faith and guilt over his mother's death.
Karras is dismissed after a break, as Merrin knows he is not mentally fit for a second attempt.
Despite this, Karras returns to the room where Regan is now free from her binds and Merrin lies dead.
In a fit of rage he assaults Regan and orders the demon to take him instead.
Pazuzu obeys and Karras throws himself from the window.
He then dies of his injuries, but not before receiving last rites from his friend Father Dyer (William O'Malley).

Days later the McNeils leave for Los Angeles.
They meet Dyer and say goodbye.
Regan remembers nothing, but embraces him after noticing his white collar.
After missing the duo, Kinderman decides to befriend Dyer by inviting him to see a movie with him.

The Ugly Truth_0,"Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) is a morning show TV producer in Sacramento, California.
Abby firmly believes in true love and is a big supporter of complex self-help books such as Chicken Soup for the Soul and Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus.
Coming home from a disastrous date, she happens to see a segment of a local television show, The Ugly Truth, featuring Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler), whose cynicism about relationships prompts Abby to call in to argue with him on-air.
The next day, she discovers the TV station is threatening to cancel her show because of its poor ratings.
The station owner has hired Mike to do a segment on her show.

At first, the two have a rocky relationship; Abby thinks Mike is crass and disgusting while Mike finds her to be naive and a control freak.
Nevertheless, when she meets the man of her dreams, a doctor named Colin (Eric Winter) living next to her, Mike convinces her that by following his advice she will improve her chances with Colin.
Abby is skeptical, but they make a deal: If Mike's management of her courtship results in her landing Colin, proving his theories on relationships, she will work happily with him, but if Mike fails, he agrees to leave her show.
[2]

Mike succeeds in improving the ratings, brings married co-anchors Georgia and Larry closer and successfully instructs Abby to be exactly what Colin would want through a number of pointers including: always laugh at his jokes and say he is amazing in bed.
Mike is invited to appear on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and is offered a job at another network.
Abby is forced to cancel a romantic weekend away with Colin, during which they had planned to finally sleep together, and instead fly to Los Angeles to persuade Mike to stay with her show.

They drink and dance and Mike admits he does not want to move because he wants to stay in Sacramento near his sister and nephew.
In the hotel elevator, they passionately kiss, but go to their separate rooms.
Mike, dealing with the intensity of his feelings for Abby, calls on her room only to find Colin has shown up to surprise her.
Mike leaves.
Abby is upset and soon realizes Colin only likes the woman she has been pretending to be, not the real her.
She breaks up with him.

Mike quits and takes a job with a rival TV station in Sacramento, and ends up doing a broadcast at the same hot air balloon festival as Abby.
He cannot resist intruding when she kicks the new ""Mike Chadway"" imitator off the air and goes into a tirade about what cowardly weaklings men are.
The balloon takes off while they argue.
Abby says she broke up with Colin, and Mike admits he loves her.
Abby kisses him while they fly off, all of which is broadcast due to a camera mounted in the balloon.
The film ends with Abby and Mike in bed.

Young Frankenstein_0,"Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) is a physician lecturer at an American medical school and engaged to the tightly wound actress Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn).
He becomes exasperated when anyone brings up the subject of his grandfather, the infamous mad scientist.
To disassociate himself from his legacy, Frederick insists that his surname be pronounced ""Fronk-en-steen.""

When a solicitor informs him that he has inherited his family's estate in Transylvania after the death of his great grandfather, the Baron Beauvort von Frankenstein, Frederick travels to Europe to inspect the property.
At the Transylvania train station, he is met by a hunchbacked, bulging-eyed servant named Igor, pronounced as ""eye-gore"" (Marty Feldman), and a lovely young personal assistant named Inga (Teri Garr).
Upon arrival at the estate, Frederick meets the forbidding housekeeper Frau Blücher (Cloris Leachman), whose name causes horses to rear up and neigh madly in fright.
Though his family legacy has brought shame and ridicule, Frederick becomes increasingly intrigued about his grandfather's work, especially after Inga assists him in discovering the secret entrance to his grandfather's laboratory.
Upon reading his grandfather's private journals, Frederick is so transformed that he decides to resume his grandfather's experiments in re-animating the dead.
He and Igor resort to robbing the grave of a recently executed criminal, and Frederick sets to work experimenting on the large corpse.
Matters go awry, however, when Igor is sent to steal the brain of a deceased revered scientist, Hans Delbruck; startled by lightning, he drops and ruins Delbruck's brain.
Taking a second brain, Igor returns with a brain labeled ""Do Not Use This Brain!
Abnormal"" (which he subsequently refers to as ""A-b (Abby) Normal""), which Frederick unknowingly transplants into the corpse.

Soon, Frederick is ready to re-animate his creature (Peter Boyle), who is elevated on a platform to the roof of the laboratory during a lightning storm.
Eventually, electrical charges bring the creature to life.
The creature makes its first halting steps, but, frightened by Igor lighting a match, attacks Frederick and must be sedated.
Upon being asked whose brain was obtained, Igor confesses that he supplied ""Abby Normal's"" (abnormal) brain, unknowingly creating the Monster.

The townspeople are uneasy at the possibility of Frederick continuing his grandfather's work.
Most concerned is Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars), a police official who sports an eyepatch and monocle over the same eye, a creaky, disjointed wooden arm, and an accent so comically thick even his own countrymen cannot understand him.
Kemp visits the doctor and subsequently demands assurance that he will not create another monster.
Upon returning to the lab, Frederick discovers that Frau Blücher is setting the creature free.
After she reveals the monster's love of violin music, and her own romantic relationship with Frederick's grandfather, the creature is enraged by sparks from a thrown switch, and escapes from the Frankenstein castle.

While roaming the countryside, the Monster has frustrating encounters with a young girl and a blind hermit (Gene Hackman); these scenes directly parody the original Frankenstein movies.
Frederick recaptures the monster and locks the two of them in a room, where he calms the monster's homicidal tendencies with flattery and fully acknowledges his own heritage, shouting out emphatically, ""My name is Frankenstein!""
(This time, he uses the more common, Anglicized pronunciation.)

Frederick offers the sight of ""The Creature"" following simple commands to a theater full of illustrious guests.
The demonstration continues with Frederick and the monster launching into the musical number ""Puttin' on the Ritz,"" complete with top hats and tails.
Although the monster can only shout his song lines in painfully high-pitched monotones, he dances impressively with almost perfect timing.
The routine ends disastrously, however, when a stage light explodes and frightens the monster, who becomes enraged, pushes Frederick, and charges into the audience, where he is captured and chained by police.

The monster escapes, then kidnaps and ravishes the not unwilling Elizabeth when she arrives unexpectedly for a visit.
Elizabeth falls in love with the creature due to his inhuman stamina and his enormous penis (referred to as Schwanstuker or Schwanzstück — a Yiddish word from Schwanz, ""tail,"" which also is German slang for ""penis,"" and Stück, ""piece"").

The townspeople hunt for the monster.
Desperate to get the creature back, Frederick plays the violin to lure his creation back to the castle.
Just as the Kemp-led mob storms the laboratory, Frankenstein transfers some of his stabilizing intellect to the creature who, as a result, is able to reason with and placate the mob.
The film ends happily, with Elizabeth married to the now erudite and sophisticated monster--with her hair styled identically to that of the female creature from The Bride Of Frankenstein, while Inga joyfully learns what her new husband Frederick got in return during the transfer procedure--the monster's Schwanzstück.","[STR_SENT] Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) is a physician lecturer at an American medical school and engaged to the tightly wound actress Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn).

It is a way of finding the thief who stole Polson's credit cards and used one of them to check into the hotel.

Jack waits downstairs while Algren and VanZant head to room 27, where it turns out that the thief is Ganz.
Ganz immediately kills VanZant, and shoots Algren, while Billy attends to some other business in the room next door to room 27.

Jack hears the shots and rushes upstairs, where Algren tells him to go downstairs and find Ganz and Billy.
Jack confronts Ganz and Billy downstairs.
When Algren makes it downstairs, Ganz takes Jack's .44 revolver and uses it to kill Algren, and then Ganz and Billy escape with Jack's gun.

The police station issues Jack a new gun, a Colt 1911 .45, and fellow cop Ben Kehoe (Brion James) tells Jack about Ganz's former partner Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy), who is in prison with 6 months to go on a three-year sentence for armed robbery.
Jack tells his boss, Haden (Frank McRae), that he wants to work alone in the search for Ganz, and then Jack visits Reggie at the prison.

Jack gets Reggie a 48 hour leave from the prison so Reggie can help Jack find Ganz and Billy.
Reggie leads Jack to an apartment that Ganz's last remaining partner, Luther (David Patrick Kelly), lives in.

Jack and Reggie do not know that a few days ago, Ganz and Billy kidnapped Luther's girlfriend Rosalie (Kerry Sherman).
When Jack steps inside Luther's apartment and starts looking around, Luther runs upstairs to the apartment and fires a shot at Jack.

Jack chases Luther to Jack's car, where Reggie is handcuffed to the steering wheel.
After getting nothing out of Luther, Jack puts Luther in jail.
That night, Reggie leads Jack to Torchy's, a redneck hangout where Billy used to be a bartender.

Reggie, on a challenge from Jack, shakes the bar down in a famous scene, single-handedly bringing the crowd under his control.
They get a lead on Billy's old girlfriend, but this also leads nowhere, as the girlfriend says she threw Billy out.
Jack, frustrated to the boiling point, lets loose on Reggie and they get into a relentless but ridiculous fistfight.

Reggie finally tells Jack about the $500,000, stashed in the trunk of his car, the spoils of a drug deal gone bad when Ganz apparently sold Reggie out.
The money is in the trunk of Reggie's car, parked in a garage for three years.
It was also the prime reason why Ganz & Billy took Luther's girlfriend: they wanted Luther to get Reggie's money in exchange for her return to him.

Luther goes and gets the car, and Jack and Reggie tail him to a Muni station where Ganz comes to get the money.
Luther, however, recognizes Jack, and Ganz and Billy escape, while Reggie chases after Luther.

Left with nothing, Jack ends up sitting at the station waiting for Reggie to call.
Kehoe, about to leave, reminds Jack about a message from ""your pal from the vice squad.""

Jack goes to Vroman's, in the Fillmore district, to find Reggie, who has tracked Luther to a hotel across the street.
Jack, humbled, apologizes for continuously berating and insulting Reggie.
He lends Reggie some money to pay for a hotel room, but when Reggie leaves to fool around with a girl he's met, he sees Luther leave the hotel.

Luther gets onto a stolen bus driven by Billy and hands over the money to Ganz.
Luther asks if Rosalie is okay.
Ganz reminds Luther that he promised that he would not hurt her, then shoots Luther.
What happens to Rosalie is left ambiguous.
Ganz spots Jack and Reggie following them, and a car chase/gunfight ensues, which ends when Billy forces Jack's Cadillac through the window of a Cadillac showroom.
At this point following a heated verbal thrashing from Jack's boss Haden, Jack and Reggie are ready to resign themselves to the fact that they failed to catch Ganz.

At a local bar before Reggie goes back to prison, Jack wonders if Billy might go back to see his girl and use her place as a hideout.
It turns out that Billy did.

Jack and Reggie force their way inside and after a brief confrontation Reggie shoots Billy.
Ganz escapes into a maze of alleyways, capturing Reggie.
Jack approaches and shoots Ganz, throwing him off Reggie, then finishes him off by shooting him repeatedly.
Reggie is almost shocked by Jack's stone face and lack of feeling killing another man.

Finally, Jack takes Reggie to go fool around with the girl he had been chasing.
They agree to meet again when Reggie gets out of San Quentin in six months.
Jack leaves the money in Reggie's car, but asks for a loan on another Cadillac when he gets out.
Reggie insists to Jack that he will be an honest man going forward.
Jack seems to accept this, and Jack takes Reggie back to prison.","[STR_SENT] Convicted thief Albert Ganz (James Remar) is working as part of a road gang in California, when a big Native American man named Billy Bear (Sonny Landham) drives up in a pickup truck and asks for water to cool off his truck’s overheating radiator.

When Harry Met Sally_0,"In 1977, Harry Burns (Crystal) and Sally Albright (Ryan) finish school at the University of Chicago and share the drive to New York City, where Sally is beginning journalism school and Harry is starting a career; at the time, Harry is dating a friend of Sally's, Amanda (Nicastro).

During the drive they discuss their differing ideas about relationships between men and women.
Harry says that ""Men and women can't be friends because the sex part always gets in the way"".
Sally disagrees, claiming that men and women can be strictly friends without sex.
During a stop in a diner, Sally is angered when Harry tells her she is attractive; she accuses him of making a pass at her.
In New York, due to their divergent philosophies, they part on unfriendly terms.

Five years later, they meet in a New York airport and find themselves on the same plane.
Both are in relationships; Sally has just started dating a man named Joe (Ford) — who is an old friend of Harry's — and Harry is engaged to a woman named Helen, which surprises Sally.
Harry suggests they become friends, forcing him to elaborate on his previous rule about male-female friendships; they can never be friends because the sex part gets in the way.
Despite Harry's suggestions of exceptions to that rule, they separate concluding that they will not be friends.

Harry and Sally run into each other again five years later, in a New York bookstore.
They have coffee and talk about their previous relationships, both of which have ended.
After leaving the café, they take a walk and decide to be friends.
In subsequent scenes, they have late-night phone conversations, go to dinner, and spend a lot of time together.
Their dating experiences with others continue to highlight their different approaches to relationships and sex.

During a New Year's Eve party, Harry and Sally find themselves attracted to each other.
Though they remain friends, they set each other up with their respective best friends, Marie (Fisher) and Jess (Kirby).
The four go to a restaurant, where Marie and Jess hit it off; they later get engaged.
One night, Sally tearfully tells Harry over the phone that her ex, Joe, is getting married to his legal assistant, and he rushes to her apartment to comfort her.
They unexpectedly have sex that night, resulting in an awkward moment the next morning as Harry quickly leaves in a state of distress.
This creates tension in their relationship.
Their friendship cools for three weeks until the two have a heated argument during Jess and Marie's wedding dinner.
Following this fight, Harry repeatedly attempts to mend his friendship with Sally.

Then, at a New Year's Eve party that year, Sally feels alone without Harry by her side.
Meanwhile, Harry is shown spending New Year's alone.
As she decides to leave the party early, Harry appears and declares his love for her; they make up and kiss.","[STR_SENT] In 1977, Harry Burns (Crystal) and Sally Albright (Ryan) finish school at the University of Chicago and share the drive to New York City, where Sally is beginning journalism school and Harry is starting a career; at the time, Harry is dating a friend of Sally's, Amanda (Nicastro).

The Shipping News (film)_1,"Quoyle's father tosses him into the water, expecting him to naturally swim. The image of struggling to swim returns to Quoyle's mind in times of crisis.

Quoyle lives a lonely life and works as an inksetter in a small newspaper in Poughkeepsie, New York. He becomes infatuated with a vivacious local woman named Petal, marrying her and having a daughter they name Bunny. Six years later, Petal runs off with a lover and Bunny, only to die soon after in a car accident. Bunny is returned by the police to Quoyle, who tell him that Petal had sold their daughter off for $6,000 to an illegal adoption agency. Only days before Quoyle had received the news that his ailing parents killed one another in a suicide pact. After collecting their ashes, Quoyle's aunt Agnis arrives wishing to pay her respects to her brother. Agnis is moving to the ancestral family home in Newfoundland, which has been abandoned for 44 years. Realizing that Quoyle is at a total loss through grief, she first offers to stay a few more days and help him through the crisis, and then persuades him to move with her.

While struggling to rebuild his life, fix up the derelict house, and care for his daughter, Quoyle meets local resident Wavey Prowse, a widow who has a pre-teen boy with a learning disability. Wavey's son and Quoyle's daughter become friends, while the two adults become friends, and then more. Wavey has dark secrets in her past, but so does the Quoyle family.

To support himself and his daughter, Quoyle takes a job at the local newspaper Gammy Bird as the ""Shipping News"" correspondent, covering shipping traffic in town, as well as local car crashes. With no experience in journalism, Quoyle struggles to produce decent articles and incurs the dislike of the newspaper's second in command, Tert Card. An article Quoyle writes about a millionaire's yacht docked in town, however, becomes a great success with readers, and the newspaper's editor, Jack Buggit, is so impressed that he commissions him to write a series of articles profiling boats and the personal history of their owners.

A storm destroys the Quoyle home, and Jack, caught in the rope of a lobster pot while fishing, is believed drowned. His body is recovered, appears to be dead, but is actually in a deep state of shock resulting from hypothermia. During his wake, at his home in front of mourners, he regains consciousness.

8mm (film)_0,"Private investigator Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) is contacted by Daniel Longdale (Anthony Heald), attorney for wealthy widow Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter), whose husband has recently died.
While clearing out her late husband's safe, she and Mr. Longdale found an 8 mm film which appears to depict a real murder, but Mrs. Christian wants to know for certain.

After looking through missing persons files, Tom discovers the girl is Mary Ann Mathews, and visits her mother, Janet Mathews (Amy Morton).
While searching the house with her permission, he finds Mary Ann's diary, in which she says she went to Hollywood to become a film star.
He asks Mrs. Mathews if she wants to know the truth, even if it is a horrible one.
She says that she wants to know what happened to her daughter, so after reading the diary and a note left for her mother inside of it, he leaves it for her and then leaves.

In Hollywood, with the help of an adult video store employee called Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), Tom penetrates the underworld of illegal pornography.
Contact with a sleazy talent scout named Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini) leads them to director Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare), whose violent pornographic films star a masked man known as ""Machine"".
To gain more evidence, Tom pretends to be a client interested in commissioning a hardcore bondage film to be directed by Velvet and starring Machine.
Velvet agrees and arranges a meeting in New York City.

At the meeting, attorney Longdale appears and explains that Christian had contracted him to procure a snuff film.
Longdale says that he told Velvet that Tom might come looking for them.
Realizing that the snuff film was authentic, the private eye knows he is at risk.
Velvet and Machine produce a bound and beaten Max, whom they abducted to force Tom to bring them the only surviving copy of the illegal film.
Once he delivers it, but before he turns it over, they kill Max and beat Tom and then burn the film.
As they are about to kill Tom, he tells them that Christian had paid $1,000,000 for the film and that the reason Christian wanted the film made was for the simple reason that he had enough money to make it possible.
Velvet, Poole, and Machine received much less and that Longdale kept the major portion.
In an ensuing fight, Velvet and Longdale are both killed; Tom wounds Machine and escapes.

He calls Mrs. Christian to tell her his discoveries and recommends going to the police, to which she agrees.
Arriving at her estate, Tom is told that Mrs. Christian committed suicide after hearing the news.
She left envelopes for the Mathews family and Tom: it contains the rest of his payment and a note reading, ""Try to forget us.""

Tom decides to seek justice for the murdered girl by killing the remaining people involved.
Tracking down Eddie, Tom takes him to the shooting location and tries to kill him.
He calls Mrs. Mathews to tell her about her daughter and asks for her permission to punish those responsible.
With that, he returns beats Eddie to death with his pistol, before burning his body and pornography from his car.
Tom traces Machine and attacks him at home.
Tom unmasks him, revealing a bald, bespectacled man named George (Chris Bauer).
He says, ""What did you expect?
A monster?""
George goes on to tell Tom that he has no ulterior motive for his sadistic actions; he does them simply because he enjoys it.
They struggle, and Tom kills him.

X-Men (film)_0,"In 1944 German-occupied Poland, a 13-year-old Erik Lehnsherr is separated from his parents upon entry to a concentration camp.
In attempting to reach them, he causes a set of gates to bend towards him, as though attracted by a magnetic force.
Decades later, in the not too distant future, Senator Robert Kelly attempts to pass a ""Mutant Registration Act"" in Congress which would force mutants to publicly reveal their identities and abilities.
Present are Lehnsherr, now known as Magneto, and the telepathic Professor Charles Xavier, who privately discuss their differing viewpoints on the relationship between humans and mutants.

In Meridian, Mississippi, 17-year-old Marie D'Ancanto accidentally puts her boyfriend into a coma upon kissing him which was caused by her unknown superhuman ability to absorb the life force and mutant abilities of anyone she touches.
In fear that she is harmful, Marie, now going by the name of Rogue runs away to Laughlin City, Alberta.

The Mummy (1999 film)_1,"In Thebes, Egypt, 2,134 BC, high priest Imhotep engaged in an affair with Anck-su-Namun, the mistress of Pharaoh Seti I.
When the Pharaoh discovered their tryst, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murdered the monarch.
As Seti's guards arrive, Imhotep fled while Anck-su-Namun killed herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her.
After Anck-su-Namun's burial, Imhotep and his priests stole her corpse and travelled to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, where they began the resurrection ceremony.
However, they were intercepted by Seti's guards before the ritual could be completed, and Anck-su-Namun's soul was sent back to the Underworld.
Imhotep's priests were mummified alive; Imhotep was sentenced to immortal agony, condemned to suffer the Hom Dai curse, buried alive with flesh-eating scarab beetles.
He was buried under high security, sealed away in a sarcophagus at the feet of a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis, and kept under strict surveillance by warriors known as the Medjai; for all humanity would be doomed should he resurface.

4,159 years later in 1925, Jonathan Carnahan presents his sister Evelyn, a Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist, an intricate box and map which Jonathan says he found in Thebes.
After the pair discover the map leads to Hamunaptra, Jonathan reveals he stole it from an American adventurer named Rick O'Connell, currently in prison.
Evelyn and Jonathan visit Rick; he tells them that he knows the location of the city because his unit of the French Foreign Legion found the location years ago.
He makes a deal with Evelyn to reveal the location of Hamunaptra, in exchange for Evelyn saving Rick from being hanged.

Rick leads Evelyn and Jonathan's small expedition to the city, where the group encounters a band of American treasure hunters led by the famed British Egyptologist Dr. Allen Chamberlain and guided by Beni Gabor, a cowardly former comrade of Rick.
Shortly after reaching Hamunaptra, the expeditions are attacked by the Medjai, led by the warrior Ardeth Bay.
Ardeth warns them of the evil buried in the city, but despite his warning, the two expeditions continue to excavate in separate portions of the city.
Evelyn searches for the Book of Amun-Ra, a solid gold book reportedly capable of taking life away, but comes across the remains of Imhotep instead.
The team of Americans, meanwhile, discover a box containing the black Book of the Dead, accompanied by canopic jars carrying Anck-su-Namun's preserved organs; Chamberlain steals the Book of the Dead while each of the Americans pockets a jar as loot.
Before opening the box, Chamberlain reads an engraving saying that any and all who open the box are cursed if Imhotep is awakened.
The men ignore the warnings, but Beni refuses to assist them, and flees.

At night, Evelyn takes the Book of the Dead and reads a page aloud, accidentally awakening Imhotep.
The expeditions flee to Cairo, but Imhotep follows them with the help of Beni, who bargains with Imhotep; the antagonist promises not to kill Beni in return.
Imhotep absorbs the life from the American expedition, returning to full strength.
Seeking a way to stop Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum.
After Evelyn reveals that Imhotep referred to her as Anck-su-Namun in Hamunaptra, Ardeth and museum curator Terrence Bay hypothesize that Imhotep wants to resurrect his lover again and will do so by sacrificing Evelyn.
Evelyn muses that if the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of Amun-Ra can kill him again.
After discovering the location of the Book, Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves.
Evelyn agrees to accompany Imhotep if he spares the lives of the rest of the group.
Imhotep goes back on his word and leaves his slaves to kill the group anyway.
However, Rick discovers an entrance to the sewers and they escape.
Terrence sacrifices himself to buy the others time to escape.

Imhotep, Evelyn and Beni return to Hamunaptra, pursued by Rick, Jonathan, and Ardeth.
Evelyn is rescued after an intense battle with Imhotep's mummified priests, and she reads from the Book of Amun-Ra.
Imhotep becomes mortal, and Rick stabs him, forcing him into the River of Death.
Rapidly decaying, Imhotep leaves the world of the living, vowing revenge with the same words he carved into his sarcophagus, Death is only the beginning.
While looting treasure from the pyramid, Beni accidentally sets off an ancient booby trap and is trapped by a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs as Hamunaptra collapses into the sand.
The heroes escape, although they lose the Book of Amun-Ra in the process.
Rick, Jonathan and Evelyn ride off into the sunset on a pair of camels laden with Beni's treasure.","[STR_SENT] In Thebes, Egypt, 2,134 BC, high priest Imhotep engaged in an affair with Anck-su-Namun, the mistress of Pharaoh Seti I.

[END_SENT] [STR_SENT] When the Pharaoh discovered their tryst, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murdered the monarch. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] As Seti's guards arrive, Imhotep fled while Anck-su-Namun killed herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] After Anck-su-Namun's burial, Imhotep and his priests stole her corpse and travelled to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, where they began the resurrection ceremony. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] However, they were intercepted by Seti's guards before the ritual could be completed, and Anck-su-Namun's soul was sent back to the Underworld. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Imhotep's priests were mummified alive; Imhotep was sentenced to immortal agony, condemned to suffer the Hom Dai curse, buried alive with flesh-eating scarab beetles. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] He was buried under high security, sealed away in a sarcophagus at the feet of a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis, and kept under strict surveillance by warriors known as the Medjai; for all humanity would be doomed should he resurface. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] 4,159 years later in 1925, Jonathan Carnahan presents his sister Evelyn, a Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist, an intricate box and map which Jonathan says he found in Thebes. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] After the pair discover the map leads to Hamunaptra, Jonathan reveals he stole it from an American adventurer named Rick O'Connell, currently in prison. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Evelyn and Jonathan visit Rick; he tells them that he knows the location of the city because his unit of the French Foreign Legion found the location years ago. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] He makes a deal with Evelyn to reveal the location of Hamunaptra, in exchange for Evelyn saving Rick from being hanged. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Rick leads Evelyn and Jonathan's small expedition to the city, where the group encounters a band of American treasure hunters led by the famed British Egyptologist Dr. Allen Chamberlain and guided by Beni Gabor, a cowardly former comrade of Rick. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Shortly after reaching Hamunaptra, the expeditions are attacked by the Medjai, led by the warrior Ardeth Bay. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Ardeth warns them of the evil buried in the city, but despite his warning, the two expeditions continue to excavate in separate portions of the city. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Evelyn searches for the Book of Amun-Ra, a solid gold book reportedly capable of taking life away, but comes across the remains of Imhotep instead. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The team of Americans, meanwhile, discover a box containing the black Book of the Dead, accompanied by canopic jars carrying Anck-su-Namun's preserved organs; Chamberlain steals the Book of the Dead while each of the Americans pockets a jar as loot. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Before opening the box, Chamberlain reads an engraving saying that any and all who open the box are cursed if Imhotep is awakened. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The men ignore the warnings, but Beni refuses to assist them, and flees. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] At night, Evelyn takes the Book of the Dead and reads a page aloud, accidentally awakening Imhotep. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The expeditions flee to Cairo, but Imhotep follows them with the help of Beni, who bargains with Imhotep; the antagonist promises not to kill Beni in return. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Imhotep absorbs the life from the American expedition, returning to full strength. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Seeking a way to stop Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] After Evelyn reveals that Imhotep referred to her as Anck-su-Namun in Hamunaptra, Ardeth and museum curator Terrence Bay hypothesize that Imhotep wants to resurrect his lover again and will do so by sacrificing Evelyn. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Evelyn muses that if the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of Amun-Ra can kill him again. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] After discovering the location of the Book, Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Evelyn agrees to accompany Imhotep if he spares the lives of the rest of the group.

Blade (film)_2,"A seductive woman leads a young man to a rave club filled with dozens of vampires.
He bumps into the club owner, who would later be revealed as Deacon Frost, a young upstart in the vampire community.
The music peaks when blood is sprayed from the sprinklers above (a blood rain) and the young man flees as the vampires begin to feed on the human members in the club.
In the middle of the carnage, an armor clad vampire-hunter named Blade arrives.
The crowd breaks into a frenzy as the ""Daywalker"" (vampires call him before attacking) displays extraordinary skills and strength against armed guards, eventually saving the young man's life.
Blade slaughters the vampires in the club, leaving only Quinn alive and horribly burned as the police arrive on the scene.

Blade tracks Quinn down to a hospital, but the vampire is able to bite a resident hematologist, Dr. Karen Jenson, before escaping once again.
Blade brings Karen back to his lair and introduces her to Abraham Whistler, his mentor and weaponsmith.
Karen resolves to study vampirism and find an antidote before she becomes a vampire herself.
In working to find a stable, viable cure she soon discovers that the anticoagulant EDTA reacts explosively with the vampire infection.
Meanwhile, Frost clashes with his vampire elders.
He believes that vampires should rise from the shadows and enslave humanity.
The elders believe in the subversive rule of (both human and vampire) society through their influence with police, politics, finance and real estate.
Moreover, because he was not born a vampire as they were, they both shame him and shun him for his radical views and reckless activities.
Frost studies ancient vampire lore and comes to believe that he can awaken La Magra, a bloodgod, to gain godlike absolute power.
Together with his minions, he kidnaps and kills the chief vampire of the region and imprisons the other elders.

Blade combats Frost's various minions in an effort to uncover his ultimate plan.
After another encounter with Quinn and Frost's lover Mercury, Whistler would explain to a suspicious Karen that Blade's mother Vanessa was attacked while pregnant and that Blade is a half-vampire hybrid with all their superhuman strengths but none of their weaknesses except the bloodthirst.
After witnessing Whistler give Blade a serum to counter the thirst, Karen successfully develops an antidote to cure herself of vampirism.
While Blade is out on an errand, Frost and his crew manage to invade Blade's lair, kidnap Karen and mortally wound Whistler.
Blade gives the infected Whistler a gun to commit suicide, then arms himself with a number of weapons and a large supply of EDTA.
He storms Frost's penthouse, overrunning the bodyguards, and soon discovers Vanessa - his own mother, whom he believed long dead, in Frost's bed.
She reveals that Frost was the vampire that bit her while Blade was still in her womb and caused him to become the Daywalker.
More guards arrive and attack Blade as Frost intimates a long since sexual relationship with Vanessa and proclaims himself as creator of their ""family"".
Thunderstruck, Blade is defeated and taken (with Karen) to the Temple of Eternal Night for Frost's blood ritual sacrifice.

The temple antichamber drains Blade's blood and filters it through the ancient channels of the temple.
Karen manages to escape the pit Frost dropped her in and feed Blade her blood, doubling his strength and giving him an animalistic power to fight the vampires.
Meanwhile lightning strikes the temple and filters into the sanctuary as Frost sacrifices the elder vampires in a mystic ritual and painfully gains the power of La Magra.
However the unintended result was not the awakening of the bloodgod but the culmination of the dead elders souls that fought absorption as the energies consume Frost's body.
Vanessa attacks Blade forcing him to kill her.
In the melee, Karen would secure a shotgun from a guard, shoot him dead and kills Mercury with concentrated garlic spray.
Blade then furiously cuts through Quinn and the rest of Frost's minions before engaging Frost in rapidfire swordplay.
Frost's new powers make him immune to Blade's conventional weapons, so Blade injects him, multiple times with EDTA, causing Frost to explode.
As the pair leave the temple, Karen offers to cure Blade but he chooses to forgo the cure in order to continue hunting vampires and asks her to develop a better serum.
An epilogue finds Blade killing a vampire attacking his date in Russia, intimating that Blade's new campaign has spread into Europe.","[STR_SENT] A seductive woman leads a young man to a rave club filled with dozens of vampires.

[END_SENT] [STR_SENT] While Blade is out on an errand, Frost and his crew manage to invade Blade's lair, kidnap Karen and mortally wound Whistler. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Blade gives the infected Whistler a gun to commit suicide, then arms himself with a number of weapons and a large supply of EDTA. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] He storms Frost's penthouse, overrunning the bodyguards, and soon discovers Vanessa - his own mother, whom he believed long dead, in Frost's bed. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] She reveals that Frost was the vampire that bit her while Blade was still in her womb and caused him to become the Daywalker. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] More guards arrive and attack Blade as Frost intimates a long since sexual relationship with Vanessa and proclaims himself as creator of their ""family"". [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Thunderstruck, Blade is defeated and taken (with Karen) to the Temple of Eternal Night for Frost's blood ritual sacrifice. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The temple antichamber drains Blade's blood and filters it through the ancient channels of the temple. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Karen manages to escape the pit Frost dropped her in and feed Blade her blood, doubling his strength and giving him an animalistic power to fight the vampires. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Meanwhile lightning strikes the temple and filters into the sanctuary as Frost sacrifices the elder vampires in a mystic ritual and painfully gains the power of La Magra. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] However the unintended result was not the awakening of the bloodgod but the culmination of the dead elders souls that fought absorption as the energies consume Frost's body. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Vanessa attacks Blade forcing him to kill her. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] In the melee, Karen would secure a shotgun from a guard, shoot him dead and kills Mercury with concentrated garlic spray. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Blade then furiously cuts through Quinn and the rest of Frost's minions before engaging Frost in rapidfire swordplay. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Frost's new powers make him immune to Blade's conventional weapons, so Blade injects him, multiple times with EDTA, causing Frost to explode. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] As the pair leave the temple, Karen offers to cure Blade but he chooses to forgo the cure in order to continue hunting vampires and asks her to develop a better serum. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] An epilogue finds Blade killing a vampire attacking his date in Russia, intimating that Blade's new campaign has spread into Europe. [END_SENT] ",3,15,19,24,32
Superman (1978 film)_0,"On the dying planet Krypton, using evidence provided by scientist Jor-El, the Ruling Council sentences three attempted insurrectionists, General Zod, Ursa and Non, to ""eternal living death"" in the Phantom Zone.
Despite his eminence, Jor-El is unable to convince the Council of his belief that Krypton will soon explode.
To save his infant son Kal-El, Jor-El launches a spacecraft containing the child towards Earth, a distant planet with a suitable atmosphere, and where Kal-El's dense molecular structure will give him superhuman powers.
Shortly after the launch, Krypton is destroyed.

Three years later, the ship lands near an American farming town, Smallville, where Kal-El is found by Jonathan and Martha Kent.
The Kents take the child back to their farm and raise him as their own son, naming him Clark after Martha's maiden name.
At age 18, soon after the death of Jonathan, Clark hears a psychic ""call,"" discovering a glowing green crystal in the remains of his ship.
It compels him to travel to the Arctic, where the crystal builds the Fortress of Solitude, resembling the architecture of Krypton.
Inside, a vision of Jor-El explains Clark's origins, educating him in his powers and responsibilities.
After 12 years, with his powers fully developed, Clark leaves the Fortress with a colorful costume and becomes a reporter at the Daily Planet in Metropolis.
He meets and develops a romantic attraction to coworker Lois Lane, but she sees him as awkward and unsophisticated.

Lois becomes involved in a helicopter accident where conventional means of rescue are impossible, requiring Clark to use his powers in public for the first time to save her.
During the same night, he rescues Air Force One after a flameout, thwarts a jewel thief attempting to scale the Solow Building with suction cups, intercedes in a police chase where many of the robbers escape via cabin cruiser (which Superman deposits on Wall Street), and even finds time to rescue a little girl's cat in Brooklyn Heights, making the mysterious ""caped wonder"" a celebrity.
The hero visits Lois at home, takes her for a flight over the city, and allows her to interview him for an article in which she names him ""Superman.""
Meanwhile, criminal genius Lex Luthor has developed a cunning plan to make a fortune in real estate by buying large amounts of barren desert land and then diverting a nuclear missile test flight to the San Andreas Fault.
The missile will sink California and leave Luthor's desert as the new West Coast of the United States, greatly increasing its value.

After his incompetent henchman Otis accidentally redirects the first rocket to the wrong place, Luthor's girlfriend Eve Teschmacher successfully changes the course of a second missile.
Knowing Superman could stop his plan, Luthor lures him to his underground lair and exposes him to Kryptonite.
As Superman weakens, Luthor taunts him by revealing that the first missile is a decoy, headed due east towards Hackensack, New Jersey.
Luthor knows that even Superman cannot stop both impacts.
Teschmacher is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack, but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman to a slow death.
Knowing the hero's reputation for keeping his word, Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition that he will deal with the New Jersey missile first.
After diverting the east-bound missile into outer space, Superman witnesses the west-bound missile detonating in the San Andreas Fault.
Superman is able to mitigate the effects of the nuclear explosion, getting rid of the pollution from the fall-out and shoring up the crumbling earth, but the aftershocks are still devastating.

While Superman is busy saving others, Lois's car falls into a crevice that opens due to an aftershock.
It quickly fills with dirt and debris and she suffocates to death.
Angered at being unable to save Lois, Superman ignores Jor-El's warning not to interfere with human history, preferring to remember Jonathan Kent's advice that he must be on Earth for ""a reason"".
He travels back in time in order to save Lois, altering history so that her car is never caught in the aftershock; he then delivers Luthor and Otis to prison and flies into the sunrise for further adventures.","[STR_SENT] On the dying planet Krypton, using evidence provided by scientist Jor-El, the Ruling Council sentences three attempted insurrectionists, General Zod, Ursa and Non, to ""eternal living death"" in the Phantom Zone.

His photographer girlfriend Carrie Laughlin (Michelle Forbes) persuades him to move to California, they decide to drive from Pittsburgh to California and visit infamous murder sites along the way.
Short on funds, Brian posts a ride-share ad.

Meanwhile, psychopathic parolee Early Grayce (Brad Pitt) has just lost his job.
His parole officer (Judson Vaughn) learns of this and comes to the trailer park where Early lives with his young girlfriend Adele Corners (Juliette Lewis).

Early decides to go to the job interview; and, when he is on his way out, he is confronted by the landlord over non-payment of rent.
Early grows violent and spins out in his car, chasing the man all over the park.

Early spies the ride-share ad at the college and calls Brian, who agrees to meet him the following day.
Early sends Adele ahead and, as revealed later, murders the landlord before joining Adele to wait for Brian and Carrie.
Carrie's first response to seeing the rough-hewn couple is to suggest Brian turn the car around and leave, but Brian asks her to give the plan a chance, and she reluctantly agrees.

On the road, unbeknownst to his companions, Early murders a man in a gas station bathroom and steals his money.
When they arrive at the first hotel, he cuts Adele's hair to match Carrie's.
At another hotel, Early invites Brian out to play pool, leaving Adele and Carrie alone together.
Adele reveals to Carrie that she is a rape victim and that she views Early as her protector, even though her mother did not approve because Early had just been released from prison.
Carrie is alarmed by Brian's growing fascination with Early and nonchalant response to the news that Early has been in prison.
She gives him an ultimatum; either they rid themselves of Early and Adele, or she will leave.

Early kills the gas station attendant and continues the trip with the couple as hostages.
They encounter two police officers, whom Early shoots.
Early orders Brian to finish off one of the wounded officers, but Brian refuses.
They next come to the home of an elderly couple.
Early beats the man to death, but Adele allows the woman to flee.

Brian regains consciousness, and the elderly woman gives him the keys to her truck.
Brian arrives at an abandoned nuclear testing site and surprises Early, hitting him in the head with a shovel.
Brian finds Carrie bloodied and handcuffed to a bed, having been sexually assaulted.
Early, who was only stunned, attacks Brian and they struggle until Early is hit over the head by Carrie.
When Early continues the attack, Brian shoots him in the abdomen.
Early is not mortally wounded, Brian realizes this and shoots him again, killing him.

The film ends with Brian and Carrie in a California beach house.
Carrie, who now sports long hair (eschewing the short style that Early had Adele emulate during the trip), tells Brian that a gallery is interested in her art, and he suggests they go out to celebrate.
He leaves his tape player on; and Adele's voice is heard, talking about how good Carrie and Brian were to her and Early, and how much their friendship means to her.","[STR_SENT] Brian Kessler (David Duchovny) is a graduate student in psychology and a journalist, who has written an article about serial killers, which draws interest from a publisher that offers him a book deal.

The Sting_0,"The film takes place in 1936, at the height of the Great Depression.
Johnny Hooker, a grifter in Joliet, Illinois, cons $11,000 in cash from an unsuspecting victim with the aid of his partners Luther Coleman and Joe Erie.
Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago to teach him ""the big con"".
Unfortunately, their victim was a numbers racket courier for vicious crime boss Doyle Lonnegan.
Corrupt Joliet police Lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing Lonnegan's involvement and demanding part of Hooker’s cut.
Having already spent his share, Hooker pays Snyder in counterfeit bills.
Lonnegan's men murder Luther, and Hooker flees for his life to Chicago.

Hooker finds Henry Gondorff, a once-great con-man now hiding from the FBI, and asks for his help in taking on the dangerous Lonnegan.
Gondorff is initially reluctant, but he relents and decides to resurrect an elaborate and supposedly obsolete scam known as ""the wire"", using a crew of con artists to create a phony off-track betting parlor.

Aboard the opulent 20th Century Limited, Gondorff, posing as boorish Chicago bookie Shaw, buys into Lonnegan's private, high-stakes poker game.
Shaw infuriates Lonnegan with his obnoxious behavior, then out-cheats him to win $15,000.
Hooker, posing as Shaw's disgruntled employee, Kelly, is sent to collect the winnings and instead convinces Lonnegan that he wants to take over Shaw's operation.
""Kelly"" reveals that he has a partner named Les Harmon (actually con man Kid Twist) in the Chicago Western Union office, who will allow them to win bets on horse races by past-posting.

Meanwhile, Snyder has tracked Hooker to Chicago, but his pursuit is thwarted when he is summoned by undercover FBI agents led by Agent Polk, who orders him to assist in their plan to arrest Gondorff using Hooker.
At the same time, Lonnegan has grown frustrated with his men's inability to find and kill Hooker.
Unaware that Kelly is Hooker, he demands that Salino, his best assassin, be given the job.
A mysterious figure with black leather gloves is then seen following and observing Hooker.

Kelly's connection appears effective, as Harmon provides Lonnegan with the winner of one horse race and the trifecta of another race.
Lonnegan agrees to finance a $500,000 bet at Shaw's parlor to break Shaw and gain revenge.
Shortly thereafter, Snyder captures Hooker and brings him before FBI Agent Polk.
Polk forces Hooker to betray Gondorff by threatening to incarcerate Luther Coleman's widow.

The night before the sting, Hooker sleeps with Loretta, a waitress from a local restaurant.
As Hooker leaves the building the next morning, he sees Loretta walking toward him.
The black-gloved man appears behind Hooker and shoots her dead – she was Lonnegan's hired killer, Loretta Salino, and the shooter was hired by Gondorff to protect Hooker.

Armed with Harmon’s tip to ""place it on Lucky Dan"", Lonnegan makes the $500,000 bet at Shaw’s parlor on Lucky Dan to win.
As the race begins, Harmon arrives and expresses shock at Lonnegan's bet, explaining that when he said ""place it"" he meant, literally, that Lucky Dan would ""place"" (i.e., finish second).
In a panic, Lonnegan rushes the teller window and demands his money back.
As this happens, Agent Polk, Lt. Snyder, and a half dozen FBI officers storm the parlor.
Polk confronts Gondorff, then tells Hooker he is free to go.
Gondorff, reacting to the betrayal, shoots Hooker in the back.
Polk then shoots Gondorff and orders Snyder to get the ostensibly respectable Lonnegan away from the crime scene.
With Lonnegan and Snyder safely away, Hooker and Gondorff rise amid cheers and laughter.
Agent Polk is actually Hickey, a con man, running a con atop Gondorff's con to divert Snyder and provide a solid ""blow off"".
As the con men strip the room of its contents, Hooker refuses his share of the money, saying ""I'd only blow it"", and walks away with Gondorff.","[STR_SENT] The film takes place in 1936, at the height of the Great Depression.

My Best Friends Wedding_0,"Julianne Potter (Julia Roberts), a 27-year-old New York restaurant critic, receives a call from her longtime friend Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney).
In college, the two made an agreement that if neither of them were married by the time they turned 28, they would marry each other.
Three weeks before her 28th birthday, Michael tells her that in four days, he will marry Kimmy Wallace (Cameron Diaz), a 20-year-old University of Chicago student from a wealthy family.

Julianne is upset that Michael will marry someone so wrong for him, and someone he has known for such a short period of time.
She realizes that she is in love with Michael, and heads to Chicago, intent on sabotaging his wedding.
Soon after arriving she meets Kimmy, who asks her to be the maid of honor.
This sets off a comical scenario in which Julianne must pretend to be the dutiful maid of honor while secretly scheming ways to prevent the wedding from happening.
She engages in petty sabotage—for example, taking Kimmy and Michael to a karaoke bar after discovering that Kimmy is a terrible singer—and later asks her gay friend George Downes (Rupert Everett) to pretend they are engaged, hoping to make Michael jealous.

When these tactics fail, George persuades Julianne to do the obvious: tell Michael she is in love with him.
One morning, Michael gets Julianne alone and tells her that it'll be the last time they ever get to be alone.
He expresses some skepticism in marrying Kimmy, explaining that he and Kimmy don't share a special song like he and Julianne do.
Michael discreetly gives Julianne the invitation to tell him she's in love with him, but she lets the moment ""pass her by.""
Michael starts singing their song as he grabs Julianne and holds her while they dance one last time.
The next morning which happens to be the wedding day, they take a walk and Julianne confesses her love to Michael, asks him to marry her instead, and passionately kisses him.
Kimmy witnesses this and runs off, but Michael chases her.

Julianne pursues him but finally realizes Michael loves Kimmy.
She apologizes and explains to Kimmy that she kissed Michael unexpectedly, but he didn't kiss her back because he was in love with Kimmy.

The Time Machine (1960 film)_2,"On January 5, 1900, four friends arrive for a dinner at a house located near London, but their host, H. George Wells, is absent.
As requested, they begin without him, but then George staggers in, exhausted and disheveled.
He begins to recount his adventures since they last met on New Year's Eve, 1899.

A week earlier, George discusses time as ""the fourth dimension"" with friends, among them David Filby (Young) and Dr. Philip Hillyer (Sebastian Cabot).
He shows them a tiny machine that he claims can travel in time, stating that a larger version can carry a man ""into the past or the future"".
When activated, the device blurs and disappears.
Most of his friends dismiss it as a trick, but after the others have gone, Filby warns George to destroy the machine.
They agree to meet again next Friday with the others.

George uses the Time Machine to travel to the future.
He first leaves the machine on September 13, 1917, where he meets James Filby (Young again), whom he mistakes for his father, David.
James informs George that his father had ""died in the war"", and that the United Kingdom has been at war with Germany since 1914.
He tells him that an inventor lived across the road who disappeared around the turn of the century and that his father wanted to keep the house in case the owner ever returned.
George then travels to June 19, 1940, into the midst of ""a new war"", which he briefly stops in as his machine is buffeted from side to side.
George's next stop is August 19, 1966, in a futuristic metropolis.
He is puzzled to see people hurrying into a fallout shelter amid the blare of air raid sirens.
An older James Filby tells him to get into the shelter.
James spots an atomic satellite zeroing in and flees into the shelter.
A nuclear explosion causes a volcano to erupt.
Civilization is destroyed in a nuclear holocaust.
George restarts the machine just in time to avoid being incinerated, but lava covers the machine, then cools and hardens, forcing him to travel far into the future until it erodes away.

He stops the machine on October 12,[2] 802,701, next to a low building with a large sphinx on top.
George explores, and spots young people by a river.
A woman is drowning, but the others are indifferent.
George rescues her, but is surprised by her lack of gratitude or other emotion.
She calls herself Weena (Mimieux) and her people the Eloi.

George questions the Eloi, wanting to know more about their civilization.
He asks about their books, only to learn they have been left to decay and turn to dust.
Outraged by the Elois' apathy and lack of curiosity, George returns to where he had left his time machine, to find that it has been dragged into the sphinx-building, behind locked metal doors.
Weena follows George and insists they go back, for fear of ""Morlocks"" at night.
A monster jumps out of the bushes and tries to drag Weena off, but George rescues her and wards the beast off with fire.
Weena informs him that the hideous creature was one of the Morlocks.

The next day, Weena shows George what appear to be domed well-like air-shafts in the ground.
She then takes him to an ancient museum, where ""talking rings"" tell of a centuries-long nuclear war/holocaust.
One group of survivors remained underground in the shelters and evolved into the Morlocks, while the other group, which became the Eloi, returned to the surface.
George starts climbing down a shaft, but turns back when a siren begins blaring from atop the sphinx-building.
Weena and the rest of the Eloi enter a trance-like state, and complacently file through the now-open doors of the building.
When the siren stops, the doors close, trapping Weena and others inside.

To rescue Weena, George climbs down a shaft and enters the subterranean caverns and is horrified to discover that the Eloi are little more than free range livestock to the Morlocks, who raise and cannibalise them.
He fights the Morlocks with the help of the Eloi, who prove to not be completely helpless, then escapes with them up the shafts to safety.
Under his direction, they drop dry dead tree branches into the shafts to feed the fire.
The entire area caves in, crushing and suffocating most of the Morlocks below.
The next morning, George finds the sphinx-building in charred ruins and the doors to the building open again, with his time machine sitting just inside the entrance.
He goes to retrieve his machine, but the doors close behind him and he is attacked by the remaining Morlocks.
He uses the time machine to escape back to January 5, 1900 in time to meet his old friends for dinner and to tell them of his time traveling adventure.
George's friends scoff at his story and leave; only Filby believes him.
George leaves again in the time machine.
Filby and George's housekeeper notice three books are missing from George's library which he apparently took with him.
They, and the viewer, are left to speculate which three books were removed.","[STR_SENT] On January 5, 1900, four friends arrive for a dinner at a house located near London, but their host, H.

Minority Report (film)_0,"In April 2054, Captain John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is chief of the highly controversial Washington, D.C., PreCrime police force.
They use visions of the future generated by three ""precogs"", mutated humans with precognitive abilities, to stop murders before they happen; because of this, the city has been murder-free for six years.
Though Anderton is a respected member of the force, he is addicted to Clarity, an illegal psychoactive drug he began using after the disappearance of his son Sean.
With the PreCrime force poised to go nationwide, the system is audited by Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), a member of the United States Justice Department.
During the audit, the precogs predict that Anderton will murder a man named Leo Crow in 36 hours.
Believing the incident to be a setup by Witwer, who is aware of Anderton's addiction, Anderton attempts to hide the case and quickly departs the area before Witwer begins a manhunt for him.
Anderton seeks the advice of Dr. Iris Hineman (Lois Smith), the lead researcher of the PreCrime technology.
She explains to Anderton that sometimes the three precogs see different visions of the future, in which case the system only provides data on the two reports which agree; the ""minority report"", reflecting the potential future where a predicted killer would have done something different, is discarded.
According to Dr. Hineman, the female precog Agatha is most likely to be the precog that witnesses the minority report.

Anderton undergoes a dangerous underground eye replacement to avoid detection by the city's optical recognition system.
He travels back to PreCrime and kidnaps Agatha (Samantha Morton), which disables the precogs' hive mind and shuts down the system.
Anderton takes Agatha to a shopping mall, and a hacker, who extracts both Agatha's vision of Crow's murder—with no differences from the other two precogs, so there was no minority report—and another of the murder of a woman named Anne Lively—which Agatha also showed to Anderton the day before he was incriminated.
Anderton and Agatha then head to the apartment where Crow is to be killed.
Inside, Anderton finds hundreds of pictures of children, one of which is of his son, and concludes that Crow is responsible for Sean's disappearance.
When Crow arrives, Anderton holds him at gunpoint, but ultimately decides to control his anger and places Crow under arrest instead.
Crow admits that he was hired to plant these photos and then be killed, so his family would be paid handsomely.
Since Anderton refuses to kill him, Crow grabs the officer's hand and makes him fire at point-blank range, effectively committing suicide by cop.
On the run, Anderton and Agatha approach his ex-wife Lara for refuge.
Anderton learns Lively was Agatha's former drug-addicted mother, once before a target of a failed murder attempt after requesting to see her daughter before her death.
Anderton realizes that his knowledge of the Lively case is why he is being targeted.

Meanwhile, Witwer assesses Crow's death and doubts that Anderton killed him in cold blood.
He comes to recognize that the archival footage of Lively's murder shows what appears to be a future echo (or precog seeing the perpetration again) by one of the visions, routinely discarded by PreCrime.
He, however, realizes this is a different murder as nearby water is rippling in a different direction from the original PreCrime vision.
He suspects someone used this to stage the first murder attempt, and then recreated the setting to actually kill Lively and avoid being detected by PreCrime.
Witwer realizes that the murderer would had to have been someone high up in PreCrime to have access to the vision, and reports these findings to PreCrime's Director Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow).
Burgess, aware that the PreCrime division is currently disabled due to Agatha's absence, kills Witwer and frames Anderton for that murder as well.

The PreCrime unit eventually captures Anderton and restores Agatha to the system.
Burgess attempts to comfort Lara, but accidentally reveals that he was the one that killed Lively.
Lara acts on this information and frees Anderton at gunpoint.
At a banquet to celebrate the success of the PreCrime unit attended by Burgess, Anderton plays back Agatha's vision of Lively's murder for the gathered crowd, which shows Burgess as the murderer.
While Burgess begins to hunt down Anderton, a new PreCrime report is created: Anderton is the victim and Burgess, the murderer.
When Burgess catches up to Anderton, Anderton explains the impossible situation: if Burgess kills Anderton, he proves the system works but at the cost of a life sentence, while if he does not, the system will not have worked and the PreCrime division will be shut down.
Anderton explains the fundamental flaw in the system: if one knows his or her future, he or she can change it.
Burgess resolves the dilemma by killing himself.
The PreCrime program is shut down and the prisoners are unconditionally pardoned and released, though police departments keep watch on many of them.
Anderton and Lara remarry and start a new family.
The precogs are sent to an ""undisclosed location"", a small uncharted island in the North Atlantic Ocean to live out a full happy life in peace.","[STR_SENT] In April 2054, Captain John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is chief of the highly controversial Washington, D.C., PreCrime police force. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] They use visions of the future generated by three ""precogs"", mutated humans with precognitive abilities, to stop murders before they happen; because of this, the city has been murder-free for six years. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Though Anderton is a respected member of the force, he is addicted to Clarity, an illegal psychoactive drug he began using after the disappearance of his son Sean. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] With the PreCrime force poised to go nationwide, the system is audited by Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), a member of the United States Justice Department. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] During the audit, the precogs predict that Anderton will murder a man named Leo Crow in 36 hours. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Believing the incident to be a setup by Witwer, who is aware of Anderton's addiction, Anderton attempts to hide the case and quickly departs the area before Witwer begins a manhunt for him. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Anderton seeks the advice of Dr. Iris Hineman (Lois Smith), the lead researcher of the PreCrime technology. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] She explains to Anderton that sometimes the three precogs see different visions of the future, in which case the system only provides data on the two reports which agree; the ""minority report"", reflecting the potential future where a predicted killer would have done something different, is discarded. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] According to Dr. Hineman, the female precog Agatha is most likely to be the precog that witnesses the minority report. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Anderton undergoes a dangerous underground eye replacement to avoid detection by the city's optical recognition system. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] He travels back to PreCrime and kidnaps Agatha (Samantha Morton), which disables the precogs' hive mind and shuts down the system. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Anderton takes Agatha to a shopping mall, and a hacker, who extracts both Agatha's vision of Crow's murder—with no differences from the other two precogs, so there was no minority report—and another of the murder of a woman named Anne Lively—which Agatha also showed to Anderton the day before he was incriminated. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Anderton and Agatha then head to the apartment where Crow is to be killed. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Inside, Anderton finds hundreds of pictures of children, one of which is of his son, and concludes that Crow is responsible for Sean's disappearance. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] When Crow arrives, Anderton holds him at gunpoint, but ultimately decides to control his anger and places Crow under arrest instead. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Crow admits that he was hired to plant these photos and then be killed, so his family would be paid handsomely. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Since Anderton refuses to kill him, Crow grabs the officer's hand and makes him fire at point-blank range, effectively committing suicide by cop. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] On the run, Anderton and Agatha approach his ex-wife Lara for refuge. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Anderton learns Lively was Agatha's former drug-addicted mother, once before a target of a failed murder attempt after requesting to see her daughter before her death. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Anderton realizes that his knowledge of the Lively case is why he is being targeted. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Meanwhile, Witwer assesses Crow's death and doubts that Anderton killed him in cold blood. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] He comes to recognize that the archival footage of Lively's murder shows what appears to be a future echo (or precog seeing the perpetration again) by one of the visions, routinely discarded by PreCrime. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] He, however, realizes this is a different murder as nearby water is rippling in a different direction from the original PreCrime vision. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] He suspects someone used this to stage the first murder attempt, and then recreated the setting to actually kill Lively and avoid being detected by PreCrime. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Witwer realizes that the murderer would had to have been someone high up in PreCrime to have access to the vision, and reports these findings to PreCrime's Director Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow). [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Burgess, aware that the PreCrime division is currently disabled due to Agatha's absence, kills Witwer and frames Anderton for that murder as well. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The PreCrime unit eventually captures Anderton and restores Agatha to the system. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Burgess attempts to comfort Lara, but accidentally reveals that he was the one that killed Lively. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Lara acts on this information and frees Anderton at gunpoint. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] At a banquet to celebrate the success of the PreCrime unit attended by Burgess, Anderton plays back Agatha's vision of Lively's murder for the gathered crowd, which shows Burgess as the murderer. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] While Burgess begins to hunt down Anderton, a new PreCrime report is created: Anderton is the victim and Burgess, the murderer. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] When Burgess catches up to Anderton, Anderton explains the impossible situation: if Burgess kills Anderton, he proves the system works but at the cost of a life sentence, while if he does not, the system will not have worked and the PreCrime division will be shut down. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Anderton explains the fundamental flaw in the system: if one knows his or her future, he or she can change it. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Burgess resolves the dilemma by killing himself. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The PreCrime program is shut down and the prisoners are unconditionally pardoned and released, though police departments keep watch on many of them. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Anderton and Lara remarry and start a new family. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The precogs are sent to an ""undisclosed location"", a small uncharted island in the North Atlantic Ocean to live out a full happy life in peace. [END_SENT] ",4,5,13,30,33

The Time Machine (1960 film)_1,"On January 5, 1900, four friends arrive for a dinner at a house located near London, but their host, H. George Wells, is absent.
As requested, they begin without him, but then George staggers in, exhausted and disheveled.
He begins to recount his adventures since they last met on New Year's Eve, 1899.

A week earlier, George discusses time as ""the fourth dimension"" with friends, among them David Filby (Young) and Dr. Philip Hillyer (Sebastian Cabot).
He shows them a tiny machine that he claims can travel in time, stating that a larger version can carry a man ""into the past or the future"".
When activated, the device blurs and disappears.
Most of his friends dismiss it as a trick, but after the others have gone, Filby warns George to destroy the machine.
They agree to meet again next Friday with the others.

George uses the Time Machine to travel to the future.
He first leaves the machine on September 13, 1917, where he meets James Filby (Young again), whom he mistakes for his father, David.
James informs George that his father had ""died in the war"", and that the United Kingdom has been at war with Germany since 1914.
He tells him that an inventor lived across the road who disappeared around the turn of the century and that his father wanted to keep the house in case the owner ever returned.
George then travels to June 19, 1940, into the midst of ""a new war"", which he briefly stops in as his machine is buffeted from side to side.
George's next stop is August 19, 1966, in a futuristic metropolis.
He is puzzled to see people hurrying into a fallout shelter amid the blare of air raid sirens.
An older James Filby tells him to get into the shelter.
James spots an atomic satellite zeroing in and flees into the shelter.
A nuclear explosion causes a volcano to erupt.
Civilization is destroyed in a nuclear holocaust.
George restarts the machine just in time to avoid being incinerated, but lava covers the machine, then cools and hardens, forcing him to travel far into the future until it erodes away.

He stops the machine on October 12,[2] 802,701, next to a low building with a large sphinx on top.
George explores, and spots young people by a river.
A woman is drowning, but the others are indifferent.
George rescues her, but is surprised by her lack of gratitude or other emotion.
She calls herself Weena (Mimieux) and her people the Eloi.

George questions the Eloi, wanting to know more about their civilization.
He asks about their books, only to learn they have been left to decay and turn to dust.
Outraged by the Elois' apathy and lack of curiosity, George returns to where he had left his time machine, to find that it has been dragged into the sphinx-building, behind locked metal doors.
Weena follows George and insists they go back, for fear of ""Morlocks"" at night.
A monster jumps out of the bushes and tries to drag Weena off, but George rescues her and wards the beast off with fire.
Weena informs him that the hideous creature was one of the Morlocks.

The next day, Weena shows George what appear to be domed well-like air-shafts in the ground.
She then takes him to an ancient museum, where ""talking rings"" tell of a centuries-long nuclear war/holocaust.
One group of survivors remained underground in the shelters and evolved into the Morlocks, while the other group, which became the Eloi, returned to the surface.
George starts climbing down a shaft, but turns back when a siren begins blaring from atop the sphinx-building.
Weena and the rest of the Eloi enter a trance-like state, and complacently file through the now-open doors of the building.
When the siren stops, the doors close, trapping Weena and others inside.

To rescue Weena, George climbs down a shaft and enters the subterranean caverns and is horrified to discover that the Eloi are little more than free range livestock to the Morlocks, who raise and cannibalise them.
He fights the Morlocks with the help of the Eloi, who prove to not be completely helpless, then escapes with them up the shafts to safety.
Under his direction, they drop dry dead tree branches into the shafts to feed the fire.
The entire area caves in, crushing and suffocating most of the Morlocks below.
The next morning, George finds the sphinx-building in charred ruins and the doors to the building open again, with his time machine sitting just inside the entrance.
He goes to retrieve his machine, but the doors close behind him and he is attacked by the remaining Morlocks.
He uses the time machine to escape back to January 5, 1900 in time to meet his old friends for dinner and to tell them of his time traveling adventure.
George's friends scoff at his story and leave; only Filby believes him.
George leaves again in the time machine.
Filby and George's housekeeper notice three books are missing from George's library which he apparently took with him.
They, and the viewer, are left to speculate which three books were removed.","[STR_SENT] On January 5, 1900, four friends arrive for a dinner at a house located near London, but their host, H.

While She Was Out_0,"On Christmas Eve, suburban housewife Della Myers (Kim Basinger) gets into an argument with her abusive husband Kenneth (Craig Sheffer).
After putting her two children to bed, she drives to the mall to buy some wrapping paper and cards.
At the mall, she can't find a parking space for a while and angrily leaves a note on the window of a car that is parked using up two parking spaces.
She leaves the store as the mall is closing, and the parking lot is nearly deserted.
She notices the note is gone from the 'offending' car.
As she enters her own car, the car on which she had left the note pulls up behind her.

She confronts the car, and four young men emerge—Huey (Jamie Starr), Vingh (Leonard Wu), and Tomás (Luis Chávez)—led by Chuckie (Lukas Haas).
They threaten to rape her.
Della insults Chuckie, and a security guard intervenes, but he is shot dead by Chuckie.
As the gang realizes that they have committed a murder, Della manages to start her car and drive away.
They follow her, intending to kill her, as she is the only witness.
As they pursue her some distance, she eventually crashes her car in a deserted area where homes are under construction.
She takes a road flare and a toolbox out of her car and hides behind a back hoe.

Della runs through the buildings under construction to hide as they search for her.
After some time, the thugs corner and threaten her by name, as they had found her drivers license in her purse in her car.
As they have her open the toolbox, she hits Chuckie with a crescent wrench, and escapes again into some nearby woods.
In the process of chasing her, Tomás steps on Huey, who falls and breaks his neck.

After some hide and seek in the woods, Della beats and finally kills Tomás with a lug wrench.
She flees through a creek, pursued by Chuckie and Vingh.
Della sneaks up on Vingh and kills him with a screwdriver and hides behind a fallen tree.
Chuckie tries to persuade Della to give up; he talks about her kids, saying that he is going to pay them a visit.
He tells her what he thinks of her, that she lives a boring life she doesn't want, mistreated by her husband.
He finds her, touches, and teases her face.
She holds his hand, pulls him down and they kiss.
He draws his weapon as they engage in foreplay.
She tells him to fuck her, and as he is distracted she ignites the road flare and blinds him, takes his weapon, and kills him.

Della returns home.
Her husband Kenneth complains she was out late and is tracking mud throughout the house, but Della ignores him.
She goes upstairs to check on her children who are both sleeping.

While She Was Out_1,"On Christmas Eve, suburban housewife Della Myers (Kim Basinger) gets into an argument with her abusive husband Kenneth (Craig Sheffer).
After putting her two children to bed, she drives to the mall to buy some wrapping paper and cards.
At the mall, she can't find a parking space for a while and angrily leaves a note on the window of a car that is parked using up two parking spaces.
She leaves the store as the mall is closing, and the parking lot is nearly deserted.
She notices the note is gone from the 'offending' car.
As she enters her own car, the car on which she had left the note pulls up behind her.

She confronts the car, and four young men emerge—Huey (Jamie Starr), Vingh (Leonard Wu), and Tomás (Luis Chávez)—led by Chuckie (Lukas Haas).
They threaten to rape her.
Della insults Chuckie, and a security guard intervenes, but he is shot dead by Chuckie.
As the gang realizes that they have committed a murder, Della manages to start her car and drive away.
They follow her, intending to kill her, as she is the only witness.
As they pursue her some distance, she eventually crashes her car in a deserted area where homes are under construction.
She takes a road flare and a toolbox out of her car and hides behind a back hoe.

Della runs through the buildings under construction to hide as they search for her.
After some time, the thugs corner and threaten her by name, as they had found her drivers license in her purse in her car.
As they have her open the toolbox, she hits Chuckie with a crescent wrench, and escapes again into some nearby woods.
In the process of chasing her, Tomás steps on Huey, who falls and breaks his neck.

After some hide and seek in the woods, Della beats and finally kills Tomás with a lug wrench.
She flees through a creek, pursued by Chuckie and Vingh.
Della sneaks up on Vingh and kills him with a screwdriver and hides behind a fallen tree.
Chuckie tries to persuade Della to give up; he talks about her kids, saying that he is going to pay them a visit.
He tells her what he thinks of her, that she lives a boring life she doesn't want, mistreated by her husband.
He finds her, touches, and teases her face.
She holds his hand, pulls him down and they kiss.
He draws his weapon as they engage in foreplay.

The Time Machine (1960 film)_0,"On January 5, 1900, four friends arrive for a dinner at a house located near London, but their host, H. George Wells, is absent.
As requested, they begin without him, but then George staggers in, exhausted and disheveled.
He begins to recount his adventures since they last met on New Year's Eve, 1899.

A week earlier, George discusses time as ""the fourth dimension"" with friends, among them David Filby (Young) and Dr. Philip Hillyer (Sebastian Cabot).
He shows them a tiny machine that he claims can travel in time, stating that a larger version can carry a man ""into the past or the future"".
When activated, the device blurs and disappears.
Most of his friends dismiss it as a trick, but after the others have gone, Filby warns George to destroy the machine.
They agree to meet again next Friday with the others.

George uses the Time Machine to travel to the future.
He first leaves the machine on September 13, 1917, where he meets James Filby (Young again), whom he mistakes for his father, David.
James informs George that his father had ""died in the war"", and that the United Kingdom has been at war with Germany since 1914.
He tells him that an inventor lived across the road who disappeared around the turn of the century and that his father wanted to keep the house in case the owner ever returned.
George then travels to June 19, 1940, into the midst of ""a new war"", which he briefly stops in as his machine is buffeted from side to side.
George's next stop is August 19, 1966, in a futuristic metropolis.
He is puzzled to see people hurrying into a fallout shelter amid the blare of air raid sirens.
An older James Filby tells him to get into the shelter.
James spots an atomic satellite zeroing in and flees into the shelter.
A nuclear explosion causes a volcano to erupt.
Civilization is destroyed in a nuclear holocaust.
George restarts the machine just in time to avoid being incinerated, but lava covers the machine, then cools and hardens, forcing him to travel far into the future until it erodes away.

He stops the machine on October 12,[2] 802,701, next to a low building with a large sphinx on top.
George explores, and spots young people by a river.
A woman is drowning, but the others are indifferent.
George rescues her, but is surprised by her lack of gratitude or other emotion.
She calls herself Weena (Mimieux) and her people the Eloi.

George questions the Eloi, wanting to know more about their civilization.
He asks about their books, only to learn they have been left to decay and turn to dust.
Outraged by the Elois' apathy and lack of curiosity, George returns to where he had left his time machine, to find that it has been dragged into the sphinx-building, behind locked metal doors.
Weena follows George and insists they go back, for fear of ""Morlocks"" at night.
A monster jumps out of the bushes and tries to drag Weena off, but George rescues her and wards the beast off with fire.
Weena informs him that the hideous creature was one of the Morlocks.

The next day, Weena shows George what appear to be domed well-like air-shafts in the ground.
She then takes him to an ancient museum, where ""talking rings"" tell of a centuries-long nuclear war/holocaust.
One group of survivors remained underground in the shelters and evolved into the Morlocks, while the other group, which became the Eloi, returned to the surface.
George starts climbing down a shaft, but turns back when a siren begins blaring from atop the sphinx-building.
Weena and the rest of the Eloi enter a trance-like state, and complacently file through the now-open doors of the building.
When the siren stops, the doors close, trapping Weena and others inside.

To rescue Weena, George climbs down a shaft and enters the subterranean caverns and is horrified to discover that the Eloi are little more than free range livestock to the Morlocks, who raise and cannibalise them.
He fights the Morlocks with the help of the Eloi, who prove to not be completely helpless, then escapes with them up the shafts to safety.
Under his direction, they drop dry dead tree branches into the shafts to feed the fire.
The entire area caves in, crushing and suffocating most of the Morlocks below.
The next morning, George finds the sphinx-building in charred ruins and the doors to the building open again, with his time machine sitting just inside the entrance.
He goes to retrieve his machine, but the doors close behind him and he is attacked by the remaining Morlocks.
He uses the time machine to escape back to January 5, 1900 in time to meet his old friends for dinner and to tell them of his time traveling adventure.
George's friends scoff at his story and leave; only Filby believes him.
George leaves again in the time machine.
Filby and George's housekeeper notice three books are missing from George's library which he apparently took with him.
They, and the viewer, are left to speculate which three books were removed.","[STR_SENT] On January 5, 1900, four friends arrive for a dinner at a house located near London, but their host, H.

Star Wars Episode I- The Phantom Menace_2,"The Galactic Republic is in a period of recent decline.
In response to a taxation on trade routes, the Trade Federation organizes a blockade of battleships around the planet of Naboo.
Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum dispatches two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi, to negotiate with Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray to end the blockade.

However, the Trade Federation's secret adviser, Darth Sidious, The Dark Lord of the Sith, orders the Viceroy to kill the Jedi Knights and invade Naboo with an army of battle droids.
The two Jedi escape to Naboo by stowing aboard landing craft, where Qui-Gon saves Gungan outcast Jar Jar Binks from being crushed alive by a Federation tank.
Indebted to the Jedi, Jar Jar leads them to the underwater Gungan city of Otoh Gunga; there, the Jedi unsuccessfully attempt to persuade the Gungans to help Naboo, though they are able to obtain a transport to reach the Capital city of Theed on the surface of Naboo.

The queen of Naboo, Queen Amidala, is captured by the Federation army, but is rescued by the Jedi.
The Queen escapes Naboo with the Jedi on her personal starship, which is damaged on its way through the blockade surrounding the planet, forcing them to land on the planet Tatooine for repairs.
Qui-Gon ventures into the settlement of Mos Espa with Jar Jar and the astromech droid, R2-D2, to a junk shop to purchase a new hyperdrive generator.
The Quenn's handmaiden Padmė tags along with them.

While walking around the city, they meet a nine-year-old slave child, Anakin Skywalker, a gifted pilot and engineer who has created his own protocol droid, C-3PO, who helps him around with the house chores.
Qui-Gon senses a strong presence of the Force within the boy, and suspects he may be the ""Chosen One"" of Jedi prophecy who will bring balance to the Force.
Qui-Gon makes a bet with Anakin's owner, Watto, to enter him in a podracing tournament; if Anakin wins, he will be freed.
Qui-Gon also tricks him into thinking that the ship Anakin built is his own.
Anakin wins the race and joins the group to be trained as a Jedi, but he is forced to leave his mother Shmi behind.
They are attacked by Darth Sidious' apprentice, Darth Maul, who was dispatched to capture the Queen.

Having escaped the attack, the Jedi escort the Queen to the Republic's capital planet of Coruscant so she can plead her people's case to the Galactic Senate.
Qui-Gon informs the Jedi Council about his recent attack on Tatooine and suspects of his attacker being a Sith.
Qui-Gon also asks to train Anakin as a Jedi, but the Council, concerned that the boy's future is clouded by fear, declines.
Meanwhile, Senator Palpatine of Naboo convinces the Queen to make a ""motion of no confidence"" in Valorum in attempt to vote for a stronger Chancellor who will help end the conflict.
She pushes such a vote, but grows frustrated with the corruption in the Senate, eventually deciding to return to Naboo with the Jedi Knights.

Back on Naboo, Padmé reveals herself to be the real Queen Amidala, the other ""Queen"" having been a decoy.
Padmé persuades the Gungans to form an alliance against the Trade Federation.
While Jar Jar leads his people in a battle against the droid army, the Queen tries to capture Gunray in Theed, Anakin pilots a vacant starfighter by accident and joins the fight against the Federation droid control ship in space.
Trying to find a way to leave the battle, he accidentally ventures into the ship, but then blasts through the ship and disables the sensors and the ship's engines, destroying the ship and deactivating the droid army down on Naboo.

Meanwhile, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon engage Darth Maul in a lightsaber duel.
Despite Maul's enormous skill, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon gradually force him to give ground; however, Obi-Wan is delayed when Maul knocks him off a platform, and when he catches up to them a temporary energy barrier prevents him from rejoining the duel.
Facing Qui-Gon alone, Maul mortally wounds him.
Obi-Wan arrives, and in a fit of rage cuts away half of Maul's double-bladed lightsaber; however, Maul wears him down and disarms him, trapping him on the edge of an abyss.
Obi-Wan calms himself, leaping out of the pit and summoning Qui-Gon's lightsaber; he kills Maul.
Qui-Gon asks Obi-Wan to train Anakin and become his teacher, then dies.
Palpatine is elected as the new Supreme Chancellor of the Republic and Gunray is sent to stand trial for his crimes.
Obi-Wan is made a full-fledged Jedi Knight, and the Jedi Council accepts Anakin as Obi-Wan's Padawan.
However, the Jedi are still mystified by the recent reemergence of the Sith, and even at Qui-Gon's funeral they are left to wonder if Darth Maul was the Sith master or merely the apprentice, since there are always two of them.
At a festive ceremony, Padmé presents a gift of appreciation and friendship to the Gungans.","[STR_SENT] The Galactic Republic is in a period of recent decline.

Invictus (film)_0,"On February 11, 1990, Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) is released from Victor Verster Prison after having spent 27 years in jail.
Four years later, Mandela is elected the first black President of South Africa.
His presidency faces enormous challenges in the post-Apartheid era, including rampant poverty and crime, and Mandela is particularly concerned about racial divisions between black and white South Africans, which could lead to violence.
The ill will which both groups hold towards each other is seen even in his own security detail where relations between the established white officers, who had guarded Mandela's predecessors, and the black ANC additions to the security detail, are frosty and marked by mutual distrust.

While attending a game between the Springboks, the country's rugby union team, and England, Mandela recognizes that the blacks in the stadium are cheering for England, as the mostly-white Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds; he remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on Robben Island.
Knowing that South Africa is set to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year's time, Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks.
He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, François Pienaar (Matt Damon), and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation.
Mandela also shares with François a British poem, ""Invictus"", that had inspired him during his time in prison.

François and his teammates train.
Many South Africans, both black and white, doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by nearly 50 years of racial tensions, as for many blacks, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolise white supremacy.
Both Mandela and Pienaar, however, stand firmly behind their theory that the game can successfully unite the South African country.

Things begin to change as the players interact with the fans and begin a friendship with them.
During the opening games, support for the Springboks begins to grow among the black population.
By the second game, the whole country comes together to support the Springboks and Mandela's efforts.
Mandela's security team also grows closer as the various officers come to respect their comrades' professionalism and dedication.

The Springboks surpass all expectations and qualify for the final against The All Blacks—South Africa's arch-rivals.
New Zealand and South Africa were universally regarded as the two greatest rugby nations, with the Springboks being the only side to have a winning record against the All Blacks up to this point.
[4] The first test series between the two countries in 1921 was the beginning of an intense rivalry, with emotions running high whenever the two nations met on the rugby field.

Before the game, the Springbok team visits Robben Island, where Mandela spent the first 18 of his 27 years in jail.
There Pienaar is inspired by Mandela's will and his idea of self-mastery in ""Invictus"".
François mentions his amazement that Mandela ""could spend thirty years in a tiny cell, and come out ready to forgive the people who put [him] there"".

Supported by a large home crowd of all races, Pienaar motivates his team.
Mandela's security detail receives a scare when, just before the match, a South African Airways Boeing 747 jetliner flies in low over the stadium.
It is not an assassination attempt though, but a demonstration of patriotism, with the message ""Good Luck, Bokke"" — the Springboks' Afrikaans nickname — painted on the undersides of the plane's wings.
The Springboks win the match on an added time long drop-kick from fly-half Joel Stransky, with a score of 15–12.
Mandela and Pienaar meet on the field together to celebrate the improbable and unexpected victory.
Mandela's car then drives away in the traffic-jammed streets leaving the stadium.
As Mandela watches the South Africans celebrating together from the car, his voice is heard reciting.","[STR_SENT] On February 11, 1990, Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) is released from Victor Verster Prison after having spent 27 years in jail.

Erin Brockovich (film)_0,"In 1993, Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is an unemployed single mother of three children, who has recently been injured in a traffic accident with a doctor and is suing him.
Her lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), expects to win, but Erin's courtroom behavior loses her the case.
After she makes several attempts to contact Ed at his office with no reply, Ed arrives at work to find her in the office, appearing to do work.
He confronts her, and she says that he told her things would work out and they didn't, and that she needed a job.
He feels bad for her, and decides to give her a try at the office.

Erin is given files for a real-estate case where Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) is offering to purchase the home of Hinkley, California, resident Donna Jensen.
Erin is surprised to see medical records in the file and visits Donna, who explains that she had simply kept all her PG&E correspondence together.
Donna appreciates PG&E's help: she has had several tumors and her husband has Hodgkin's disease, but PG&E has always supplied a doctor at their own expense.
Erin asks why they would do that, and Donna replies, ""because of the chromium"".
Erin begins digging into the case and finds evidence that the groundwater in Hinkley is contaminated with carcinogenic hexavalent chromium, but PG&E has been telling Hinkley residents that they use a safer form of chromium.
She persuades Ed to allow her to do further research, and wins the trust of many Hinkley residents.
She finds many cases of tumors and other medical problems in Hinkley.
Everyone has been treated by PG&E's doctors and thinks the cluster of cases is just a coincidence, unrelated to the ""safe"" chromium.

A man tells her he was tasked with destroying documents at PG&E, but noticed the medical conditions plaguing the workers and kept the documents instead.
He then gives the documents to her.
A 1966 memo proves corporate headquarters knew the water was contaminated with hexavalent chromium, did nothing about it, and advised the Hinkley operation to keep this secret.

Rather than delay any settlement for years, Ed takes the opportunity to arrange for disposition by binding arbitration.
Erin persuades all 634 plaintiffs to go along.
The judge orders PG&E to pay a settlement amount of $333 million to be distributed among the plaintiffs.
In the final scene, Ed hands Erin her bonus payment for the case, but says he has changed the amount.
She starts to complain that she deserves more respect, but is astonished to find that he has increased it to $2 million.","[STR_SENT] In 1993, Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is an unemployed single mother of three children, who has recently been injured in a traffic accident with a doctor and is suing him.

The Truman Show_0,"Truman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of The Truman Show, a reality television program in which his entire life, since before birth, is filmed by thousands of hidden cameras, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and broadcast live around the world.
The show's creator and executive producer Christof is able to capture Truman's real emotion and human behavior when put in certain situations.
Truman's hometown of Seahaven is a complete set built under a giant arcological dome in the Los Angeles area.
Truman's family and friends are all played by actors allowing Christof to control every aspect of Truman's life.
To prevent Truman from discovering his false reality, Christof has invented means of dissuading his sense of exploration, including ""killing"" his father in a storm initiated by Christof while on a fishing trip to instill in him a fear of the water, and making many news reports and commercials about the dangers of traveling, and featuring television shows about how good it is to stay at home.
Despite Christof's control, Truman has managed to behave in unexpected ways, in particular by falling in love with an extra, Sylvia, known to Truman as Lauren, instead of Meryl, the character intended to be his wife.
Though Sylvia is quickly removed from the set and Truman marries Meryl, he continues to secretly pine for her.
Sylvia becomes part of a ""Free Truman"" campaign that fights to free him from the show.

During the 30th year of the show, Truman notices certain aspects of his near-perfect world that seem out of place.
A theatrical light falls from the artificial night sky constellations, nearly hitting him (quickly passed off by local radio as an aircraft's dislodged landing light) and Truman's car radio picks up a conversation between the show's crew tracking his movements.
Truman also becomes aware of more subtle abnormalities within his regular day-to-day life, such as the way in which the same people appear in the same places at certain times each day and Meryl's tendency to blatantly advertise the various products she buys.
Truman's supposedly deceased father then reappears on the set dressed as a homeless man and is whisked away as soon as Truman notices him.

Despite the best efforts of his family and his best friend Marlon to reassure him, all these events cause Truman to start wondering about his life, realizing how the world seems to revolve around him.
Meryl grows increasingly stressed by the pressure of perpetuating the deception, and their marriage unravels in the face of Truman's increasing skepticism and attendant hostility towards her.
Truman attempts to leave Seahaven but is blocked by his inability to arrange flights, bus breakdowns, sudden traffic jams, a forest fire and a nuclear meltdown – which he becomes skeptical of when the policeman, whom Truman had never met before, calls him by name.
After Meryl breaks down and is taken off the show, Christof officially brings back Truman's father, hoping his presence will keep Truman from trying to leave.
However, he only provides a temporary respite: Truman soon becomes isolated and begins staying alone in his basement after Meryl leaves him.
One night, Truman fools the cameras and escapes the basement undetected via a secret tunnel, forcing Christof to temporarily suspend broadcasting of the show for the first time in its history.
This causes a surge in viewership, with many viewers, including Sylvia, cheering on Truman's escape attempt.

Christof orders every actor and crew member to search the town, even breaking the town's daylight cycle to help in the search.
They find that Truman has overcome his fear of the water and has sailed away from the town in a small boat named Santa Maria.
After restoring the broadcast, Christof orders the show's crew to create a large storm to try to capsize the boat, prompting a heated debate with his superiors over the morality and legality of killing Truman in front of a live audience.
Truman almost drowns, but his determination eventually leads Christof to terminate the storm.
As Truman recovers, the boat reaches the edge of the dome, its bow piercing through the dome's painted sky.
An awe-struck Truman then discovers a flight of stairs nearby, leading to a door marked ""EXIT"".
As he contemplates leaving his world, Christof speaks directly to Truman via a powerful sound system, trying to persuade him to stay and arguing that there is no more truth in the real world than there is in his own, artificial world.
Truman, after a moment's thought, delivers his catchphrase, ""In case I don't see you... good afternoon, good evening, and good night"", bows to his audience and steps through the door and into the real world.
The assembled television viewers excitedly celebrate Truman's escape, and Sylvia quickly leaves her apartment to reunite with him.
A network executive orders the crew to cease transmission.
With the show completed, members of Truman's former audience are shown looking for something else to watch.","[STR_SENT] Truman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of The Truman Show, a reality television program in which his entire life, since before birth, is filmed by thousands of hidden cameras, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and broadcast live around the world.

What Women Want_0,"Nick Marshall, a Chicago advertising executive and alpha male, who grew up with his Las Vegas showgirl mother, is a chauvinist.
He is skilled at selling to men and seducing women, including local coffee attendant Lola.
However, just as he thinks he's headed for a promotion, his manager, Dan, informs him that he is hiring the talents of Darcy McGuire instead, to broaden the firm's appeal to women.

Also, his estranged 15-year-old daughter Alex is spending two weeks with him while his ex-wife Gigi goes on her honeymoon with her new husband.
Alex is embarrassed by Nick, and resents his being protective when he meets her boyfriend.

Needing to prove himself to Darcy and Dan, Nick attempts to think of copy for a series of feminine products that Darcy distributed at the day's staff meeting.
However he slips and falls into his bathtub while holding an electric hairdryer, shocking himself.
The next day, Nick wakes up able to understand his maid's thoughts as she cleans his apartment.
As he walks through a park and encounters numerous women, he realizes that he can hear their thoughts, even those of a female poodle.
This proves to be an epiphany for him when he hears the thoughts of his female co-workers (some of whom have slept with him and regretted it).
When he goes to a previous therapist, Dr. Perkins (who also disliked him), she realizes his gift: ""If Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus, and you can speak Venutian, the world can be yours.""

Nick eavesdrops on women's thoughts and uses their ideas as his own, but also begins to develop real friendships with his co-workers.
But as he spends more time with Darcy, he is attracted to her.
However when he tries to get closer to his daughter, she resents him for trying after so many years of neglect.
Nick shrewdly suspects that her boyfriend, who is considerably older than Alex, plans to sleep with her and then dump her, but she does not want Nick's advice.

Nick and Darcy begin to spend more time together, and ultimately they kiss.
When he manages to trump Darcy out of her idea for a new Nike ad campaign aimed at women, he later regrets his selfishness, especially as it leads to her being fired.

Nick loses his gift during a storm while trying to find a company secretary, Erin, who (as his telepathic ability has shown him) is contemplating suicide.
He is also reconciled with his daughter when her boyfriend rejects her.
Nick finally visits Darcy and explains everything.
She regains her job and fires Nick, but she forgives him and agrees to save him from himself, to which he responds ""My hero"".","[STR_SENT] Nick Marshall, a Chicago advertising executive and alpha male, who grew up with his Las Vegas showgirl mother, is a chauvinist.

The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974 film)_1,"In New York City, four men heavily armed with submachine guns and all donning code names (Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Grey, and Mr. Brown), wearing similar trenchcoat, glasses and mustache disguises, board the Pelham 123 subway train of the 6 Lexington Avenue Local service at different station stops (Green at 59th Street, Grey at 51st Street, Brown at Grand Central, and finally Blue at 28th Street).
The men take the train, secure a group of seventeen passengers whom they hold hostage, isolate them in the train's first car and then separate the car from the rest of the train.

Meanwhile, Lieutenant Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau), a cynical and curmudgeonly yet light-hearted New York City Transit Authority police lieutenant, begins his day by leading four visiting Tokyo Metro directors on a tour of New York's subway command-center.
This is interrupted by Blue's radio announcement to the command center that ""your train has been taken.""
Blue (Robert Shaw), the English-accented leader of the hijackers, reveals their demands: a ransom of one million dollars, to be delivered to them within one hour, otherwise they will kill one passenger per minute once the hour has passed.

Garber, the sarcastic Lieutenant Rico Patrone (Jerry Stiller), and other transit workers cooperate while trying to guess how the criminals intend to escape the subway tunnel and get away.
Caz Dolowicz, the supervisor at Grand Central takes matters into his own hands and decides to confront the hijackers personally.
As he approaches the train, Grey (Hector Elizondo) warns him to back off but he refuses, so Grey shoots him dead.
Various clues soon surface for Garber to figure out; Blue has a very distinctive English accent, while Green (Martin Balsam) has a cold and periodically sneezes over the radio, heard by Garber, who responds by saying ""Gesundheit.""
Garber surmises that as the hijackers are able to operate the train, one is probably a disgruntled transit worker.
He also learns that one of the hostages is an undercover police officer.

The mayor finally agrees to pay the ransom at the urging of his deputy mayor and his wife (""just think what you'll get in return... Eighteen sure votes."").
Conversations between the hijackers reveal that Blue was a mercenary soldier in Africa and Green was a motorman framed by the Transit Police in a drugs bust.
There is also an undercurrent of tension between Blue and Grey; Blue confides to Green that he believes Grey is ""mad"" and potentially trouble.
During the tense wait for the money, an armed police officer in the tunnel shoots at Brown (Earl Hindman), and hijackers and police exchange fire.
In retaliation, Blue kills the conductor.
The police dispatch a squad car carrying the ransom money.
When the car is wrecked in a collision, Garber daringly bluffs to buy some time, telling the hijackers that the money already has been delivered to the 28th Street Station and only the walk down the tunnel is delaying it.
A reluctant Blue agrees to the delay.

A police motorcycle completes the trip from the scene of the collision to the subway station and two unarmed officers are sent down the track on foot to deliver the money to the hijackers.
With the money finally in hand, Blue gives Garber their next demands: that electric power be restored to the subway line, that all signals in the path of the train be set to green from 28th Street to South Ferry, and all police officers be cleared from the tunnel.
Having overridden the subway car's dead-man's switch, a safety device which requires a motorman to continually press down on the throttle or else the train will stop, the hijackers get off the train and set it in motion.
As the train starts to move, the undercover officer jumps off the train and hides between the rails.
The car begins to travel faster and faster, since no one is controlling its speed.

While following the runaway train above ground, Garber becomes convinced that it is a diversion and that the hijackers must have left it.
In the tunnel, the hijackers discard their disguises and start their escape into the tunnel's emergency exit; however, Grey refuses to leave his gun behind as agreed, resulting in a stand-off with Blue, who shoots him dead.
The undercover officer, still hiding in the tracks, manages to kill Brown with one shot.
Green escapes onto the street, while Blue shoots at the officer until he wounds him.
Garber arrives after Green has gotten away and, drawing on Blue, orders him to surrender just as Blue is about to kill the officer.
Face to face at last, Blue asks Garber if the death penalty is available in the state of New York anymore.
Told that it is not, Blue responds, ""pity"", then promptly electrocutes himself by stepping onto the third rail while a horrified Garber watches.
Meanwhile the runaway car finally encounters a red signal while entering the South Ferry Loop.
The car's emergency brakes are tripped and it grinds to a halt; the remaining hostages are all safe.

The three dead hijackers are identified, and it is apparent that none has any experience piloting trains.
Garber realizes that the hijacker still at large must be the former transit employee.
He and Patrone, working their way through a list of former motormen ""discharged for cause"" (and, by implication, disgruntled), pay a visit to Harold Longman.
Longman—known to the audience as Mr. Green—is shown rolling in the packs of ransom money on the bed in his seedy efficiency apartment when Garber and Patrone knock on his door.
He hides the money quickly, then opens to the officers and bluffs his way through their questioning.
The officers find Longman's alibi weak, but start out the door, until Longman sneezes and Garber says ""Gesundheit.""
Garber then re-opens the door, and the expression on his face indicates that he knows he has just found the final hijacker.","[STR_SENT] In New York City, four men heavily armed with submachine guns and all donning code names (Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Grey, and Mr. Brown), wearing similar trenchcoat, glasses and mustache disguises, board the Pelham 123 subway train of the 6 Lexington Avenue Local service at different station stops (Green at 59th Street, Grey at 51st Street, Brown at Grand Central, and finally Blue at 28th Street).

[END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Having overridden the subway car's dead-man's switch, a safety device which requires a motorman to continually press down on the throttle or else the train will stop, the hijackers get off the train and set it in motion. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] As the train starts to move, the undercover officer jumps off the train and hides between the rails. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The car begins to travel faster and faster, since no one is controlling its speed. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] While following the runaway train above ground, Garber becomes convinced that it is a diversion and that the hijackers must have left it. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] In the tunnel, the hijackers discard their disguises and start their escape into the tunnel's emergency exit; however, Grey refuses to leave his gun behind as agreed, resulting in a stand-off with Blue, who shoots him dead. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The undercover officer, still hiding in the tracks, manages to kill Brown with one shot. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Green escapes onto the street, while Blue shoots at the officer until he wounds him. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Garber arrives after Green has gotten away and, drawing on Blue, orders him to surrender just as Blue is about to kill the officer. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Face to face at last, Blue asks Garber if the death penalty is available in the state of New York anymore. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Told that it is not, Blue responds, ""pity"", then promptly electrocutes himself by stepping onto the third rail while a horrified Garber watches. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Meanwhile the runaway car finally encounters a red signal while entering the South Ferry Loop. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The car's emergency brakes are tripped and it grinds to a halt; the remaining hostages are all safe. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The three dead hijackers are identified, and it is apparent that none has any experience piloting trains. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Garber realizes that the hijacker still at large must be the former transit employee. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] He and Patrone, working their way through a list of former motormen ""discharged for cause"" (and, by implication, disgruntled), pay a visit to Harold Longman. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Longman—known to the audience as Mr. Green—is shown rolling in the packs of ransom money on the bed in his seedy efficiency apartment when Garber and Patrone knock on his door. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] He hides the money quickly, then opens to the officers and bluffs his way through their questioning. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The officers find Longman's alibi weak, but start out the door, until Longman sneezes and Garber says ""Gesundheit."" [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Garber then re-opens the door, and the expression on his face indicates that he knows he has just found the final hijacker. [END_SENT] ",1,18,21,35,40
The Apartment_0,"C. C. ""Bud"" Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is a lonely office drudge at a national insurance corporation in a high-rise building in New York City. In order to climb the corporate ladder, Bud allows four company managers to take turns borrowing his Upper West Side apartment for their various extramarital liaisons, which are so noisy that his neighbors assume that Bud is a playboy bringing home a different woman every night.

The four managers (played by Ray Walston, David Lewis, Willard Waterman, and David White) write glowing reports about Bud, who hopes for a promotion from the personnel director, Jeff D. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray). Sheldrake does promote Bud, but he knows why they were so enthusiastic and demands exclusive privileges to borrow the apartment himself, starting that same night. As compensation for such short notice, he gives Baxter two tickets to The Music Man.

After work, Bud catches Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), an elevator operator he has had his eye on, and asks her to go to the musical with him. She accepts, but first has to meet a former fling. He is Sheldrake, who convinces her that he is about to divorce his wife for her. They go to Bud's apartment as Bud waits forlornly outside the theater.

Later, at the company's raucous Christmas party, Sheldrake's secretary Miss Olsen (Edie Adams) drunkenly tells Fran that Fran is one of many female employees Sheldrake has seduced into affairs with the promise of divorcing his wife, including Miss Olsen herself. At Bud's apartment, Fran confronts Sheldrake, upset with herself for believing his lies. Sheldrake maintains that he genuinely loves her, but then leaves to return to his suburban family as usual.

Meanwhile, Bud accidentally learns about Sheldrake and Fran. Heartbroken, he lets himself be picked up by a woman (Hope Holiday) at a local bar. When they arrive at his apartment, he is shocked to find Fran in his bed, fully clothed and unconscious from an intentional overdose of his sleeping pills. He sends his pick-up away and enlists the help of his neighbor, Dr. Dreyfuss (Jack Kruschen), to revive Fran without notifying the authorities. To protect his job, Bud takes advantage of his playboy reputation, letting Dreyfuss believe Fran had attempted suicide after a lovers' quarrel with him.

Fran spends two days recuperating there, while Bud tries entertaining and distracting her from any suicidal thoughts. He tells her he once attempted suicide himself. They begin playing gin rummy. Bud dissuades her from phoning her family until her head is clear. During this period one of the executives arrives with a woman; Bud sends them away, but the man sees Fran. Then Fran's brother-in-law Karl Matuschka (Johnny Seven) comes to the office looking for her. Resenting Bud for denying them access to his apartment, the executives direct Karl there. When Bud again takes responsibility for Fran's actions, Karl punches him. Fran kisses Bud for not revealing her affair with Sheldrake and, sensing that she now cares for him, Bud smiles and says it ""didn't hurt a bit.""

Sheldrake rewards Bud with a further promotion, and fires Miss Olsen for what she told Fran. However, Miss Olsen retaliates by telling Sheldrake's wife, who promptly throws him out. Sheldrake moves into a room at his athletic club, but now figures that he can string Fran along while he enjoys his newfound bachelorhood.

But when Sheldrake asks Bud for the key to the apartment, Bud refuses, quitting the firm. That night at a New Year's Eve party, Sheldrake indignantly tells Fran about this. She finally realizes that Bud is the man who truly loves her. She runs to his apartment, but at the door, she hears a loud noise like a gunshot. Fearing he has attempted suicide again, Fran pounds on the door until Bud opens it, holding an overflowing bottle of champagne which was the source of the noise. Bud has been packing, planning to find a new job and a new home, but is surprised and delighted to see her. Fran insists on resuming their gin rummy game, telling Bud that she is now free as well. He declares his love for her, and she replies lovingly, ""Shut up and deal.""

Early spies the ride-share ad at the college and calls Brian, who agrees to meet him the following day.
Early sends Adele ahead and, as revealed later, murders the landlord before joining Adele to wait for Brian and Carrie.

Titanic (1997 film)_0,"In 1996, treasure hunter Brock Lovett and his team aboard the research vessel Keldysh search the wreck of RMS Titanic for a necklace with a rare diamond, the Heart of the Ocean.
They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace.
The drawing is dated April 14, 1912, the day Titanic struck the iceberg.
[Note 1] Rose Dawson Calvert, claiming to be the person in the drawing, visits Lovett and tells of her experiences aboard Titanic.

In 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fiancé Cal Hockley and her mother Ruth board Titanic.
Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve the DeWitt Bukaters' financial problems.
Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers committing suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, convinces her not to.
Discovered with Jack, Rose tells Cal she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling.
Cal is indifferent, but when Rose indicates some recognition is due, he offers Jack a small amount of money.
After Rose asks whether saving her life meant so little, he invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night.
Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, though Cal and Ruth are wary of him.
Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in steerage.

Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but later realizes she prefers him to Cal.
After rendezvousing on the ship's bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her stateroom and displays Cal's engagement present: the Heart of the Ocean.
At her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing the necklace.
They evade Cal's bodyguard and have sex in an automobile in the ship's cargo hold.
The pair later visits the ship's forward deck, witnessing a collision with an iceberg and overhearing the ship's officers and designer discussing its seriousness.

Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and a mocking note from her in his safe along with the necklace.
When Jack and Rose attempt to tell Cal of the collision, Cal has his manservant slip the necklace into Jack's pocket and accuses him of theft.
Jack is arrested, taken to the Master-at-arms' office, and handcuffed to a pipe.
Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.

With the ship sinking, Rose is desperate to free Jack.
She flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and rescues Jack.
They return to the top deck, where Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely.
After Rose boards, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself.
As her boat lowers, Rose decides she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board.
Cal takes his manservant's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon.
After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the diamond to Rose.
Cal later boards a lifeboat by carrying a lost child.

After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck.
All lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises from the water.
The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air.
Jack and Rose ride the stern into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel only buoyant enough for one person.
Holding the edge, Jack assures Rose she will die an old woman, warm in her bed.
He dies from hypothermia but Rose is saved.

With Rose hiding from Cal en route, the RMS Carpathia takes the survivors to New York.
There Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson.
She later learns Cal committed suicide after losing everything in the 1929 Wall Street Crash.

Hearing Rose's story, Lovett abandons his search.
Alone on the stern of Keldysh, Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean—in her possession all along—and drops it into the sea over the wreck site.
While she is seemingly asleep in her bed, photos on her dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure, partly inspired by Jack.

Twins (1988 film)_2,"Julius Benedict (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Vincent Benedict (Danny DeVito) are fraternal twins, the results of a secret experiment carried out at a genetics laboratory to produce the perfect child.
To the surprise of the scientists, the embryo split and twins were born.
The mother, Mary Ann Benedict, was told that Julius died at birth, and not told about Vincent at all.
Julius was informed that his mother died in childbirth.
Vincent believed his mother abandoned him.
Each twin is unaware of the other's existence.

Vincent was placed in an orphanage run by nuns in Los Angeles while Julius was taken to a South Pacific island and raised by Professor Werner (Tony Jay).
On Julius' 35th birthday, Werner tells him that he has a twin brother.
[1] Julius leaves the island to find him.

Julius discovers Vincent lives in L.A., and travels throughout the city.
Though intelligent, he is extremely naïve about the real world his more streetwise brother inhabits; at one point he inadvertently foils an attempt by two thieves to mug him.
He finds Vincent in jail.
Vincent is scornful when Julius tells him they are twins, but lets Julius bail him out and then drives off.
Julius tracks Vincent to his workplace, where he is being beaten by Morris, a member of a loan shark family known as the Klane brothers, for an unpaid debt.
Julius overpowers Morris and earns Vincent's respect and trust.
He meets Vincent's on-again-off-again girlfriend, Linda Mason (Chloe Webb).
Knowing little about women, Julius is oblivious to the flirtatious advances of her blond sister Marnie (Kelly Preston), who dislikes Vincent, but eventually falls in love with her.
Vincent shows Julius a document he stole from the orphanage which proves their mother is still alive but, believing she abandoned him, he has no interest in finding her.

Vincent steals a Cadillac to sell to his chop-shop contact, and discovers a secret prototype fuel injector in the trunk, which was to be delivered to an industrialist in Houston for $5 million.
He decides to deliver it himself and collect the money.
Webster (Marshall Bell), the original delivery man, begins ruthlessly searching for the person who stole the prototype.
At Julius' insistence, the two couples go on a cross-country journey to track Traven down.
They eventually find him in Los Alamos, New Mexico, and he tells them that their mother is living in an art colony near Santa Fe.
The Klane brothers find them again, with the intent of killing Vincent, but Julius and Vincent fight them off for the last time.
At the art colony, a woman informs them that Mary Ann is dead and they leave.
In reality, she is their mother but disbelieved their story.
Meanwhile, Webster is also getting closer to finding Vincent.

While Julius accepts their mother's death, Vincent becomes bitter and storms off, leaving Julius and the girls stranded in New Mexico, to deliver the engine to the industrialist, Beetroot McKinley.
Linda tells Julius about the engine and Julius once again sets off to find his brother.
Vincent delivers the stolen property to Beetroot, but Beetroot and his assistant are shot and killed by Webster, who then turns his attention to Vincent just as Julius arrives.
A cat-and-mouse chase ensues and Julius intercepts Webster as Vincent flees, but Vincent, feeling his brother's presence, reluctantly goes back and gives up the money to Webster.
Webster then plans to off the twins but is outsmarted causing him to end up being crushed to death by thousands of pounds of industrial chains.
Julius and Vincent make their peace, and Vincent reluctantly agrees to return the money and the stolen engine to the authorities, but secretly skims off one million.
Meanwhile, the twins' publicity reaches the art colony, and their mother realizes that the two ""comedians"" who visited her were her long-lost sons after all.

Julius and Vincent marry the Masons, and use the $50,000 reward money to start up a legitimate consulting business, using Julius' knowledge and Vincent's questionable business savvy.
