Panic Room,"Recently divorced Meg Altman (Foster) and her 11-year-old daughter Sarah (Stewart) have just purchased a four-story brownstone on the Upper West Side of New York City.
The house's previous owner, a reclusive millionaire, installed an isolated room used to protect the house's occupants from intruders.
The ""panic room"" is protected by concrete and steel on all sides, a thick steel door, and an extensive security system with multiple surveillance cameras, a public announcement system, and a separate phone line.
On the night the two move into the home, it is broken into by Junior (Leto), the previous owner's grandson; Burnham (Whitaker), an employee of the residence's security company; and Raoul (Yoakam), a ski mask-wearing gunman recruited by Junior.
The three are after $3 million in bearer bonds, which are locked inside a floor safe in the panic room.

After discovering that the Altmans have moved in earlier than expected, Junior convinces a reluctant Burnham, who assumed the house was unoccupied, to continue with their heist.
As they begin the robbery, Meg wakes up and happens to see the intruders on the video monitors in the panic room.
Before the three can reach them, Meg and Sarah run into the panic room and close the door behind them, only to find that the burglars have disabled the telephone.
Intending to force the two out of the room, Burnham introduces propane gas into the room's air vents.
Raoul, in conflict with Burnham and Junior, dangerously increases the amount of gas.
Unable to seal the vents, Meg ignites the gas while she and Sarah cover themselves with fireproof blankets, causing an explosion which vents into the room outside and causes a fire, injuring Junior.

The Altmans make several attempts to call for help, including signaling a neighbor with a flashlight through the opening of a ventilation pipe, but the neighbor ignores it.
Meg then taps into the main telephone line and gets through to her ex-husband Stephen (Bauchau), before the burglars cut them off.

When all attempts to get into the room fail, Junior lets slip that there is much more money in the safe than he let on, and gives up on the robbery.
About to leave the house, he is shot by Raoul, who forces Burnham, at gunpoint, to finish the robbery.
Stephen arrives at the home and is taken hostage by Burnham and Raoul—who severely beats him.
To make matters worse, Sarah, who has diabetes, suffers a seizure.
Her emergency glucagon syringe is in a refrigerator outside the panic room.
After using an unconscious Stephen to trick Meg into momentarily leaving the panic room, Burnham enters it, finding Sarah motionless on the floor.
After retrieving the syringe for Sarah, Meg struggles briefly with Raoul, who is thrown into the panic room, his gun knocked out of his hand.
As Meg throws the syringe into the panic room, Burnham frantically locks himself, Raoul, and Sarah inside, crushing Raoul's hand in the sliding steel door.
Meg, who now has the gun, begs the two intruders over the PA system to give Sarah the injection.
After some time Burnham, who has shown no interest in hurting either Meg or Sarah throughout the film, gives Sarah the injection.
While doing so, he tells Sarah he did not want this, and the only reason he agreed to participate was to give his own child a better life.
After Burnham gives Sarah the injection, Sarah thanks him and tells Meg that Sarah is now alright.

Having earlier received a call from Stephen, two policemen arrive, which prompts Raoul to threaten Sarah's life.
Sensing the potential danger to her daughter, Meg lies to the officers and they leave.
Meanwhile, Burnham opens the safe and removes the $22 million in bearer bonds inside.
As the robbers attempt to leave, using Sarah as a hostage, Meg hits Raoul with a sledgehammer and Burnham flees.
After a badly injured Stephen shoots at Raoul and misses, Raoul disables him and prepares to kill Meg with the sledgehammer, but Burnham, upon hearing Sarah's screams of pain, returns to the house and shoots Raoul dead, stating, ""You'll be okay now"", to Meg and her daughter before leaving.
The police, alerted by Meg's suspicious behavior earlier, arrive in force and capture Burnham, who lets the bearer bonds go; they fly away with the wind.

Later, Meg and Sarah, having recovered from their harrowing experience, begin searching the newspaper for a new home.","[STR_SENT] Recently divorced Meg Altman (Foster) and her 11-year-old daughter Sarah (Stewart) have just purchased a four-story brownstone on the Upper West Side of New York City.

Total Recall (1990 film),"In 2084, Douglas Quaid is an Earthbound construction worker having troubling dreams about Mars and a mysterious woman there.
His wife Lori dismisses the dreams and discourages him from thinking about Mars, where the governor, Vilos Cohaagen, is fighting rebels while searching for a rumored alien artifact located in the mines.
At ""Rekall"", a company that provides memory implants of vacation, Quaid opts for a memory trip to Mars as a secret agent.
However, during the procedure, Quaid violently reacts before the memory is implanted.
The company re-sedates him, wipes his memory of the Rekall visit, and sends him home.
On the way home, Quaid is attacked by his co-workers and is forced to kill them.
He then is attacked by armed thugs led by Lori and Richter, her real husband and Cohaagen's subordinate.

After evading his attackers, Quaid is given a suitcase containing money, gadgets, and a video recording.
The video is of Quaid, apparently called ""Hauser"", who explains that he used to work for Cohaagen but learned about the artifact, and underwent the memory wipe to protect himself.
The ""Hauser"" instructs Quaid on removing a tracking device, before ordering him to go to Mars and meet ""Kuato"".
Quaid makes his way to Mars and follows clues to Venusville, the colony's red-light district populated by a people mutated by poor radiation shielding.
He meets Melina, the woman from his dreams, but she spurns him, believing that Quaid is working for Cohaagen.

Quaid later encounters Lori and Rekall's President, Dr. Edgemar.
Edgemar insists Quaid is living out the implanted memories, and offers Quaid a pill that would wake him from the dream.
Quaid however sees Edgemar sweating in fear, and kills him instead.
Richter's forces capture Quaid, but Melina rescues him with Quaid killing Lori in the process.
The two race back to the Venusville bar and escape into the tunnels with their taxi driver Benny.
Unable to locate Quaid, Cohaagen shuts down the ventilation to Venusville, slowly suffocating its citizens.
Quaid, Melina, and Benny are taken to a resistance base, and Quaid is introduced to Kuato, a deformed humanoid conjoined to his brother's stomach.
Kuato reads Quaid's mind and learns that the artifact is a turbinium reactor that will create a breathable atmosphere for Mars when activated, eliminating Cohaagen's abusive monopoly on breathable air.
Cohaagen's forces burst in, led by Benny, and kill most of the resistance, including Kuato, who instructs Quaid to start the reactor.

Quaid and Melina are taken to Cohaagen, who reveals the Quaid persona was a ploy by Hauser to infiltrate the mutants and lead Cohaagen to Kuato, thereby wiping out the resistance.
Cohaagen orders Hauser's memory to be reimplanted in Quaid and Melina to be programmed to be Hauser's slave, but Quaid and Melina escape into the mines where the reactor is located.
They work their way to the control room of the reactor, killing Benny, Richter, and the rest of his men.

While running away in the reactor, Cohaagen confronts them in the control room with a bomb.
but Quaid accidentally sets it off, blowing out one of the walls of the control room, causing an explosive decompression.
Quaid grabs on the wall, but knocks Coohagen out, which causes him to land on the surface of Mars.
Due to the low atmospheric pressure, his internal fluids boil out, killing him.
Quaid manages to activate the reactor before he and Melina are also pulled out.
The reactor releases air into the Martian atmosphere, saving Quaid, Melina and the population of Venusville.
As humans walk onto the surface of the planet in its new atmosphere, Quaid takes a moment to wonder whether he is still living the memory before turning to kiss Melina.","[STR_SENT] In 2084, Douglas Quaid is an Earthbound construction worker having troubling dreams about Mars and a mysterious woman there.

The Breakfast Club,"On March 24, 1984, five students — ""criminal"" John Bender, ""athlete"" Andrew Clark, ""brain"" Brian Johnson, ""basket case"" Allison Reynolds, and ""princess"" Claire Standish — report for Saturday morning detention at Shermer High School in the Chicago suburb of Shermer, Illinois.
While not complete strangers, each of them comes from a different clique, and they seem to have nothing in common.
They gather in the high school library where they are instructed by the assistant principal, Richard Vernon, not to speak, move from their seats, or sleep for a period of eight hours, fifty-four minutes (from 7:06 AM to 4 PM).
He assigns a 1,000-word essay to the students in which each must write about who he or she is.
He then leaves, returning only occasionally to check on them.
Bender, who has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Vernon, disregards the rules and constantly riles the other students, mocking Brian and Andrew and harassing Claire.
Allison is initially quiet except for the occasional random outburst.

The students pass the hours by arguing and smoking marijuana that Bender retrieves from his locker.
Gradually, they open up to each other and reveal their deepest personal secrets: Allison is a compulsive liar, Andrew hates his father, John comes from an abusive household, Brian has contemplated suicide, and Claire is a virgin.
They discover that they all have strained relationships with their parents and are afraid of making the same mistakes as the adults around them.
However, despite these developing friendships, the students are afraid that once the detention is over, they will return to their very different cliques and never speak to each other again.

Towards the end of the day, the other students ask Brian to write the essay that Vernon assigned earlier.
Brian does so, but instead of writing about the assigned topic, he writes a letter objecting to Vernon's request to describe who they are, stating that the man has already judged who they are (an athlete, basket case, princess, brain, and criminal), and that he will not accept any different accounts from them.
Brian signs the essay as ""The Breakfast Club"" and leaves it at the table for Vernon to read after they leave.
Before the students part ways outside the school, Allison and Andrew kiss, as do Claire and John.","[STR_SENT] On March 24, 1984, five students — ""criminal"" John Bender, ""athlete"" Andrew Clark, ""brain"" Brian Johnson, ""basket case"" Allison Reynolds, and ""princess"" Claire Standish — report for Saturday morning detention at Shermer High School in the Chicago suburb of Shermer, Illinois.

Soldier (1998 American film),"In the near future, as part of a new military training program (""Project Adam""), a group of infants are selected at birth and raised as soldiers.
Undergoing extreme mental and physical training, they become virtual sociopaths, extremely disciplined, but with no understanding of anything except military routine and war.
The soldiers are conditioned to never speak unless spoken to, to completely ignore physical pain, and to address whomever they are speaking to (women included) as ""sir"".

At the age of 49, Sgt.
Todd 3465 (Kurt Russell) is a hardened veteran of many battles, but his unit is about to be replaced.
Colonel Mekum (Jason Isaacs) introduces a new group of genetically engineered soldiers, designed with superior physical attributes and a complete lack of emotion, except aggression.

Todd's unit's commander, Captain Church (Gary Busey) insists on testing the ""new"" soldiers' abilities against his own.
But Todd, the unit's best soldier, is no match for Caine 607 (Jason Scott Lee).
In the final trial, a fight between Caine and three ""old"" soldiers, two of Todd's comrades are killed, though Todd manages to gouge out one of Caine's eyes before he is defeated.
Todd seemingly dies when he falls from a great height; but the body of a dead soldier cushions his fall, and he is simply knocked unconscious.
Mekum orders their bodies dumped like garbage, and the remaining ""old"" soldiers are demoted to menial support roles.
Meanwhile Caine gets an artificial blue eye to replace the brown eye he lost.

Todd and his dead comrades are dumped on the surface of Arcadia 234, a waste disposal planet with dangerously high winds.
Though badly injured, Todd limps toward a colony of humans who crash-landed there twelve years earlier, and have managed to survive and build a society from the planet's mountains of trash.

Though they try to make him welcome, Todd has difficulty adapting to the community due to his extreme conditioning and their extreme pacifism.
Todd's training, and subsequently stunted social skills, make it difficult for him to answer in anything more than curt replies.
Many of the settlers are afraid of him, but he is accepted and sheltered by Mace (Sean Pertwee) and his wife Sandra (Connie Nielsen).
Todd develops a silent rapport with their mute son, Nathan (Jared and Taylor Throne), who had been traumatized by a snakebite earlier in his life.
In a later conflict with a coiled snake, Todd teaches Nathan how to face it down and strike back to protect himself.
His parents misinterpret the lesson, unsure of how to deal with Todd.

However, Todd soon begins to experience flashbacks from his time as a soldier and mistakes one of the pacifist colonists (Michael Chiklis) for an enemy, nearly killing him.
The pacifists decide that Todd is too dangerous to live among them, so they give him supplies and democratically vote him out of the colony.
Outside the colony, he sheds tears, but appears confused, implying that this is the first time in his life that he has ever cried.

A short time later, Mace and Sandra are almost bitten by another snake while sleeping, but are saved by Nathan, who used Todd's technique.
Mace then realizes that Todd taught their son how to protect his parents from the snakes.
He also realizes that Todd has an important role to play in their community, and decides to search for the soldier on his own and bring him back.
The colonists object, saying that they had voted him out democratically, but Mace insists that ""We voted wrong.""

The new genetically engineered soldiers arrive on the garbage planet for a training exercise.
Since the world is listed as uninhabited, Colonel Mekum decides that the pacifists' presence is unlawful and, for practice, orders his troops to slaughter them.
Frightened children hide underground and hope not to be seen.
Mace is spotted by the troops and killed just after he finds Todd.
Though outmanned and outgunned, Todd's years of battle experience and superior knowledge of the planet allow him to return to the colony and kill the advance squad attacking the pacifists.

Nervous that an unknown enemy force may be confronting them, Colonel Mekum orders the soldiers to withdraw and return with heavy artillery.
Using guerilla tactics, Todd outmaneuvers and defeats all of the remaining soldiers, including Caine 607, who is defeated in hand-to-hand combat.

Panicking, Mekum orders the transport ship's crew, composed of Todd's old squad, to set up and activate a portable nuclear device powerful enough to destroy the planet, then orders the ship to lift off, leaving the squad behind.
When Captain Church objects, Mekum shoots him in cold blood.
Before they can take off as planned, Todd appears, and his old comrades recognize him as the ranking officer due to their conditioning and silently side with him over the army that has discarded them.
Todd and his comrades take over the ship, leaving Mekum and his aides on the planet, then evacuate the remaining colonists just before the bomb detonates.
Mekum wets his pants as he realizes he is helpless.

Todd orders the ship to set course for the Trinity Moons, the colonists' original destination, then picks up Nathan and points to their new destination, while looking out upon the galaxy.","[STR_SENT] In the near future, as part of a new military training program (""Project Adam""), a group of infants are selected at birth and raised as soldiers.

Slumdog Millionaire,"In Mumbai in 2006, eighteen-year-old Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a former street child (child Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, adolescent Tanay Chheda) from the Juhu slum, is a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, and is one question away from the grand prize.
However, before the Rs.
20 million question, he is detained and interrogated by the police, who suspect him of cheating because of the impossibility of a simple ""slumdog"" with very little education knowing all the answers.
Jamal recounts, through flashbacks, the incidents in his life which provided him with each answer.
These flashbacks tell the story of Jamal, his brother Salim (adult Madhur Mittal, adolescent Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, child Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail), and Latika (adult Freida Pinto, adolescent Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar, child Rubina Ali).
In each flashback Jamal has a point to remember one person, or song, or different things that lead to the right answer of one of the questions.
The row of questions does not correspond chronologically to Jamal's life, so the story switches between different periods (childhood, adolescence) of Jamal.
Some questions do not refer to points of his life (cricket champion), but by witness he comes to the right answer.

Jamal's flashbacks begin with his managing, at age five, to obtain the autograph of Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan, which his brother then sells, followed immediately by the death of his mother during the Bombay Riots.
As they flee the riot, they run into a child version of the God Rama, Salim and Jamal then meet Latika, another child from their slum.
Salim is reluctant to take her in, but Jamal suggests that she could be the third musketeer, a character from the Alexandre Dumas novel (which they had been studying — albeit not very diligently — in school), whose name they do not know.
The three are found by Maman (Ankur Vikal), a gangster who tricks and then trains street children into becoming beggars.
When Jamal, Salim, and Latika learn Maman is blinding children in order to make them more effective as singing beggars, they flee by jumping onto a departing train.
Latika catches up and takes Salim's hand, but Salim purposely lets go, and she is recaptured by the gangsters.
Over the next few years, Salim and Jamal make a living travelling on top of trains, selling goods, picking pockets, working as dish washers, and pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal, where they steal people's shoes.
At Jamal's insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika, discovering from Arvind, one of the singing beggars, that she has been raised by Maman to become a prostitute and that her virginity is expected to fetch a high price.
The brothers rescue her, and Salim draws a gun and kills Maman.
Salim then manages to get a job with Javed (Mahesh Manjrekar), Maman's rival crime lord.
Arriving at their hotel room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him and Latika alone.
When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him, and Jamal leaves after Latika persuades him to go away (presumably so he wouldn't get hurt by Salim).

Years later, while working as a tea server at an Indian call centre, Jamal searches the centre's database for Salim and Latika.
He fails in finding Latika but succeeds in finding Salim, who is now a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's organization, and they reunite.
Salim is regretful for his past actions and only pleads for forgiveness when Jamal physically attacks him.
Jamal then bluffs his way into Javed's residence and reunites with Latika.
While Jamal professes his love for her, Latika asks him to forget about her.
Jamal promises to wait for her every day at 5 o'clock at the VT station.
Latika attempts to rendezvous with him, but she is recaptured by Javed's men, led by Salim.
Jamal loses contact with Latika when Javed moves to another house, outside of Mumbai.
Knowing that Latika watches it regularly, Jamal attempts to make contact with her again by becoming a contestant on the show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
He makes it to the final question, despite the hostile attitude of the show's host, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor), and becomes a wonder across India.
Kumar feeds Jamal the incorrect response to the penultimate question and, when Jamal still gets it right, turns him into the police on suspicion of cheating.

Back in the interrogation room, the police inspector (Irrfan Khan) calls Jamal's explanation ""bizarrely plausible"", but thinks he is not a liar and, ripping up the arrest warrant, allows him to return to the show.
At Javed's safehouse, Latika watches the news coverage of Jamal's miraculous run on the show.
Salim, in an effort to make amends for his past behaviour, quietly gives Latika his mobile phone and car keys, and asks her to forgive him and to go to Jamal.
Latika, though initially reluctant out of fear of Javed, agrees and escapes.
Salim fills a bathtub with cash and sits in it, waiting for the death he knows will come when Javed discovers what he has done.
Jamal's final question is, by coincidence, the name of the third musketeer in The Three Musketeers, a fact he never learned.
Jamal uses his Phone-A-Friend lifeline to call Salim's cell, as it is the only phone number he knows.
Latika succeeds in answering the phone just in the nick of time, and, while she does not know the answer, tells Jamal that she is safe.
Relieved, Jamal randomly picks Aramis, the right answer, and wins the grand prize.
Simultaneously, Javed discovers that Salim has helped Latika escape after he hears Latika on the show.
He and his men break down the bathroom door, and Salim kills Javed, before being gunned down himself at the hands of Javed's men.
With his dying breath, Salim gasps, ""God is great.""
Later that night, Jamal and Latika meet at the railway station and kiss.
The movie ends with a dance scene on the platform to ""Jai Ho"".","[STR_SENT] In Mumbai in 2006, eighteen-year-old Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a former street child (child Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, adolescent Tanay Chheda) from the Juhu slum, is a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, and is one question away from the grand prize.

The Crying Game,"The film opens as a psychological thriller – IRA foot soldier Fergus and a unit of other IRA fighters, including a woman named Jude and led by Maguire, kidnap Jody, a black British soldier after Jude lures him to a secluded area with the promise of sex.
The IRA demands the release of other gaoled IRA members, threatening to execute Jody in three days if their demands are not met.
While the amiable Fergus guards Jody, they develop a bond – much to the chagrin of the other IRA men.
During this time, Jody tells Fergus the story about the Scorpion and the Frog.

Jody persuades Fergus to promise to seek out his girlfriend, Dil, in London, to tell her he loved her, and protect her after Jody has been killed.
The deadline set by Jody's captors passes and Jody is to be executed.
Fergus takes Jody into the woods to carry out the sentence.
However, Jody knows that Fergus is no murderer at heart, and makes a break for it.
Sure enough, Fergus cannot bring himself to shoot the fleeing Jody in the back, but Jody is instead accidentally run over and killed by British Saracen armoured personnel carrier as they suddenly move in to assault the IRA safe-house.
With his IRA companions seemingly dead after the attack, Fergus hides from the main body of the IRA in London, where he takes a job as a day labourer, using the alias ""Jimmy"".
While in London, Fergus seeks out and meets Jody's attractive girlfriend Dil at a hair salon.
Later they talk in a bar, where the next evening he sees her singing ""The Crying Game"".

Fergus still suffers from guilt about Jody's death and sees him in his dreams bowling a cricket ball to him.
He continues to pursue Dil, protecting her from an obsessive suitor and gradually falling in love with her.
Later, when he is about to make love to her in her apartment, he discovers that she is in fact a transgender woman.
His initial reaction is of revulsion.
Rushing to the bathroom to throw up, he accidentally hits Dil in the face, leaving her with a nosebleed.
He then leaves the apartment.
A few days later, Fergus leaves Dil a note, and the two make up.
Despite everything, Dil is still attracted to him.
Around the same time, Jude unexpectedly reappears in Fergus' apartment.
She tells him that the IRA has tried and convicted him in absentia.
She forces him to agree to help with a new mission to aid in assassinating a judge.
She also off-handedly mentions that she knows about Fergus and Dil, warning him that the IRA will kill her if Fergus does not co-operate.

Fergus, however, cannot overcome his feelings for Dil, and continues wooing her.
Fergus shields her from possible retribution by giving her a haircut and male clothes, as a disguise.
The night before the IRA mission is to be carried out, Dil gets heavily drunk and Fergus has to escort her to her apartment, where Dil asks for Fergus to stay with her.
Fergus complies, then admits to Dil that he had an indirect hand in her former boyfriend's death.
Dil, drunk, appears not to have understood, but in the morning, before Fergus wakes up, Dil ties him to the bed.
Dil unwittingly prevents Fergus from joining the other IRA members and completing the planned assassination.
Holding Fergus at gunpoint, Dil forces him to tell Dil that he loves her and will never leave her.
Dil unties him, saying that, even if he is lying, it is still nice to hear his words.
Dil then breaks down in tears.

Meanwhile, Jude and Maguire gun the judge down, but Maguire is shot dead by one of his bodyguards.
A vengeful Jude enters Dil's flat with a gun, seeking to kill Fergus for missing the assassination.
Dil takes several shots at Jude, hitting her, whilst stating that she is aware that Jude was complicit in Jody's death and that Jude used her sexuality to trick him.
Dil finally kills Jude with a shot in the neck.
Dil then points the gun at Fergus, but lowers her hand, saying that she cannot kill him, because Jody will not allow her to.
Fergus prevents Dil from shooting herself, and tells her to hide out in the club for a while.
When Dil is gone, he wipes Dil's fingerprints off the gun and allows himself to be arrested in place of Dil.

The epilogue takes place a few months later – Fergus, in prison serving a sentence of over six years, is visited by Dil.
Dil, after talking with Fergus about plans once he gets out of prison, asks him why he took the fall for her in the first place.
Fergus responds, ""As a man once said, it's in my nature.""
He then tells her the story of the Scorpion and the Frog.","[STR_SENT] The film opens as a psychological thriller – IRA foot soldier Fergus and a unit of other IRA fighters, including a woman named Jude and led by Maguire, kidnap Jody, a black British soldier after Jude lures him to a secluded area with the promise of sex.

The Last Temptation of Christ (film),"The film begins with a man whispering in despair, ""The feeling begins.
Very tender, very loving.
Then the pain starts.
Claws slip underneath the skin and tear their way up.
Just before they reach my eyes, they dig in.
And I remember.
First I fasted for three months.
I even whipped myself before I went to sleep.
At first it worked.
Then the pain came back.
And the voices.
They call me by the name: Jesus.""
Jesus of Nazareth (Willem Dafoe) is a carpenter in Roman-occupied Judea, torn between his own desires and his knowledge that God has a plan for him.
This conflict results in self-loathing, and he collaborates with the Romans to crucify Jewish revolutionaries.

Judas Iscariot (Harvey Keitel), originally sent to kill Jesus for collaboration,[1] instead suspects that Jesus is the Messiah and asks him to lead a revolution against the Romans.
Jesus replies that his message is love of mankind; whereupon Judas joins Jesus in his ministry, but threatens to kill him if he strays from the purpose of a revolutionary.
Jesus also has an undisclosed prior relationship with Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey), a Jewish prostitute, who asks Jesus to stay with her, a request that he considers before leaving for a monastic community.
Jesus later saves Mary from a mob gathered to stone her for prostitution and working on the sabbath.
Jesus compels the mob to spare her life, asking ""Who here has never sinned?
"", with Jesus offering two stones.
[2] Later, Jesus preaches to the crowd using many of the parables from the Sermon on the Mount.

Jesus acquires disciples, but remains uncertain of his role.
He visits John the Baptist, who baptizes Jesus, and that night the two discuss their differing theologies and political views.
John believes that one must first gain freedom from the Romans to achieve their end, while Jesus maintains that love is more important and people should tend to matters of the spirit.
Jesus then goes into the desert to test God's connection to himself, where he is tempted by Satan as a cobra, a lion, and a pillar of flame (voiced by Barbara Hershey, Harvey Keitel, and Leo Marks), but resists each of these and instead envisions himself with an axe, being instructed by John the Baptist in answer to Jesus' dilemma of whether to choose the path of love (symbolized by the heart) or the path of violence (represented by the axe).
Jesus returns from the desert to the home of Martha and Mary of Bethany (both sisters of Lazarus), who restore him to health and attempt to persuade him that the way to please God is to have a home, a marriage, and children.
Jesus then appears to his waiting disciples to tear out his own heart and invites them to follow him.
With newfound confidence he restores sight to a blind man, changes water into wine, and raises Lazarus (Tomas Arana) from the dead.

Eventually his ministry reaches Jerusalem, where Jesus performs the Cleansing of the Temple and leads a small army to capture the temple by force, but halts on the steps to await a sign from God for what he must do next.
He begins bleeding from his hands, which he recognizes as a sign that he must die on the cross to bring salvation to mankind.
Confiding in Judas, he persuades the latter to give him to the Romans, despite Judas' inclination otherwise.
Jesus convenes his disciples for Passover seder, later known as the Last Supper; whereupon Judas leads a contingent of soldiers to arrest Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, identifying him with a kiss.
In the struggle to defend his master, Peter (Victor Argo) cuts off the ear of Malchus; whereupon Jesus reattaches it and turns himself over to the soldiers.
Pontius Pilate (David Bowie) confronts Jesus and tells him that he must be put to death because he represents a threat to the Roman Empire.
Jesus is subsequently flogged and a crown of thorns is placed on his head.
He is then crucified.

While on the cross, Jesus converses with a young girl who claims to be his guardian angel (played by Juliette Caton).
She tells him that while he is the Son of God, he is not the Messiah, and that God is pleased with him, and wants him to be happy.
She brings him down off the cross and, invisible to others, takes him to Mary Magdalene, whom he then marries.
They are soon expecting a child and living an idyllic life; but Mary abruptly dies, and Jesus is consoled by his angel; wherefore he takes Mary and Martha, the sisters of Lazarus, for his wives.
He starts a family with them, having many children, and lives his life in peace.
Jesus is next seen as an older man who encounters the apostle Paul preaching about the Messiah and tries to tell Paul that he is the man about whom Paul has been preaching.
Paul (who in this film has slain the resurrected Lazarus) repudiates him, saying that even if Jesus had not died on the cross, his message was the truth, and nothing would stop him from proclaiming that.
Jesus debates him, claiming that salvation cannot be founded on lies.

Near the end of his life, an elderly Jesus calls upon his former disciples to his deathbed.
Peter, Nathaniel, and a scarred John visit their master as Jerusalem is in the throes of rebellion; whereupon Judas comes last and reveals that the youthful angel who released Jesus from the crucifixion is in fact Satan.
Crawling back through the burning city of Jerusalem, Jesus reaches the site of his crucifixion and begs God to let him fulfill his purpose and to ""let him be God's son.""

Jesus then finds himself once more on the cross, having overcome the ""last temptation"" of escaping death, being married and raising a family, and the ensuing disaster that would have consequently encompassed mankind.
Naked and bloody, Jesus cries out in ecstasy as he dies, ""It is accomplished!
"", and the screen flickers to white.","[STR_SENT] The film begins with a man whispering in despair, ""The feeling begins. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Very tender, very loving. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Then the pain starts. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Claws slip underneath the skin and tear their way up. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Just before they reach my eyes, they dig in.

[END_SENT] [STR_SENT] At first it worked. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Then the pain came back. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] And the voices. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] They call me by the name: Jesus."" [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Jesus of Nazareth (Willem Dafoe) is a carpenter in Roman-occupied Judea, torn between his own desires and his knowledge that God has a plan for him. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] This conflict results in self-loathing, and he collaborates with the Romans to crucify Jewish revolutionaries. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Judas Iscariot (Harvey Keitel), originally sent to kill Jesus for collaboration,[1] instead suspects that Jesus is the Messiah and asks him to lead a revolution against the Romans. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Jesus replies that his message is love of mankind; whereupon Judas joins Jesus in his ministry, but threatens to kill him if he strays from the purpose of a revolutionary. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Jesus also has an undisclosed prior relationship with Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey), a Jewish prostitute, who asks Jesus to stay with her, a request that he considers before leaving for a monastic community. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Jesus later saves Mary from a mob gathered to stone her for prostitution and working on the sabbath. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Jesus compels the mob to spare her life, asking ""Who here has never sinned? "" [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] , with Jesus offering two stones. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] [2] Later, Jesus preaches to the crowd using many of the parables from the Sermon on the Mount. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Jesus acquires disciples, but remains uncertain of his role. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] He visits John the Baptist, who baptizes Jesus, and that night the two discuss their differing theologies and political views. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] John believes that one must first gain freedom from the Romans to achieve their end, while Jesus maintains that love is more important and people should tend to matters of the spirit. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Jesus then goes into the desert to test God's connection to himself, where he is tempted by Satan as a cobra, a lion, and a pillar of flame (voiced by Barbara Hershey, Harvey Keitel, and Leo Marks), but resists each of these and instead envisions himself with an axe, being instructed by John the Baptist in answer to Jesus' dilemma of whether to choose the path of love (symbolized by the heart) or the path of violence (represented by the axe). [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Jesus returns from the desert to the home of Martha and Mary of Bethany (both sisters of Lazarus), who restore him to health and attempt to persuade him that the way to please God is to have a home, a marriage, and children. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Jesus then appears to his waiting disciples to tear out his own heart and invites them to follow him. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] With newfound confidence he restores sight to a blind man, changes water into wine, and raises Lazarus (Tomas Arana) from the dead.

Juno (film),"Sixteen-year-old Minnesota high-schooler Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) discovers she is pregnant with a child fathered by her friend and longtime admirer, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera).
She initially considers an abortion.
Going to a local clinic run by a women's group, she encounters outside a school mate who is holding a rather pathetic one-person Pro-Life vigil.
Once inside, however, Juno is alienated by the clinic staff's authoritarian and bureaucratic attitudes.
She is particularly offended by their calling her ""sexually active"", a term which she feels demeans the highly emotional event by which she became pregnant.
All of this decides her against abortion, and she decides to give the baby up for adoption.
With the help of her friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby), Juno searches the ads in the Pennysaver and finds a couple she feels will provide a suitable home.
She tells her parents, Mac (J.K. Simmons) and stepmother, Bren (Allison Janney), who offer their support.
With Mac, Juno meets the couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), in their expensive home and agrees to a closed adoption.

Juno visits Mark a few times, with whom she shares tastes in punk rock and horror films.
Mark, who has set aside his rock band youth (now confined to memorabilia displayed in the one room of the house that Vanessa has designated for Mark's personal belongings), works at home composing commercial jingles.
Juno and Leah happen to see Vanessa in a shopping mall being completely at ease with a child, and Juno encourages Vanessa to talk to her baby in the womb, where it obligingly kicks for her.

As the pregnancy progresses, Juno struggles with the emotions she feels for the baby's father, Paulie, who is clearly in love with Juno.
Juno maintains an outwardly indifferent attitude toward Paulie, but when she learns he has asked another girl to the upcoming prom, she angrily confronts him.
Paulie reminds Juno that it is at her request they remain distant and tells her that she broke his heart.

Not long before her baby is due, Juno is again visiting Mark when their interaction becomes emotional.
Mark then tells her he will be leaving Vanessa.
Juno is horrified by this revelation, with Mark asking Juno ""how do you think of me"".
Vanessa arrives home, and Mark tells her he does not feel ready to be a father and there are still things he wants to do first.
Juno watches the Loring marriage fall apart, then drives away and breaks down in tears by the side of the road.
Returning to the Lorings' home, she leaves a note and disappears as they answer the door.

After a heartfelt discussion with Mac, Juno accepts that she loves Paulie.
Juno then tells Paulie she loves him, and Paulie's actions make it clear her feelings are very much reciprocated.
Not long after, Juno goes into labor and is rushed to the hospital, where she gives birth to a baby boy.
She had deliberately not told Paulie because of his track meet.
Seeing her missing from the stands, Paulie rushes to the hospital, finds Juno has given birth to their son, and comforts Juno as she cries.
Vanessa comes to the hospital where she joyfully claims the newborn boy as a single adoptive mother.
On the wall in the baby's new nursery, Vanessa has framed Juno's note, which reads: ""Vanessa: If you're still in, I'm still in.
—Juno.""
The film ends in the summertime with Juno and Paulie playing guitar and singing together, followed by a kiss.","[STR_SENT] Sixteen-year-old Minnesota high-schooler Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) discovers she is pregnant with a child fathered by her friend and longtime admirer, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera).

Unforgiven,"A group of prostitutes in Big Whiskey, Wyoming, led by Strawberry Alice, offer a $1,000 reward to whoever can kill Quick Mike and ""Davey-Boy"" Bunting, two cowboys who disfigured Delilah Fitzgerald, one of their own.
The local sheriff, Little Bill Daggett, a former gunfighter and keeper of the peace, is worried about their incentive, as he does not allow guns or criminals in his town.
Little Bill had given the two men leniency, despite their crime.

Miles away in Kansas, the Schofield Kid, a boastful young man, visits the pig farm of William Munny, seeking to recruit him to kill the cowboys.
In his youth, Munny was a bandit notorious as a cold-blooded murderer.
Now a repentant widower raising two children, he has sworn off alcohol and killing.
Though Munny initially refuses to help with the execution, his farm is failing, putting his children's future in jeopardy.
Munny reconsiders a few days later and sets off to catch up with the Kid.
On his way, Munny recruits Ned Logan, another retired gunfighter, who reluctantly leaves his wife to go along.

Back in Wyoming, gunfighter English Bob and his biographer, W. W. Beauchamp, arrive in Big Whiskey, also seeking the reward.
Little Bill and his deputies disarm Bob, and Bill beats him savagely, hoping to discourage other would-be killers.
The next morning he ejects Bob from town, but Beauchamp decides to stay and write about Bill.
He has impressed the biographer with his tales of old gunfights and seeming knowledge of the inner workings of a gunfighter's psyche.

Munny, Logan and the Kid arrive later during a rain storm; they go to the saloon/whorehouse to discover the cowboys' location.
With a bad fever after riding in the rain, Munny is sitting alone in the saloon when Little Bill and his deputies arrive to confront him.
With no idea of Munny's past, Little Bill beats him and kicks him out of the saloon after finding a pistol on him.
Logan and the Kid, upstairs getting ""advances"" on their payment from the prostitutes, escape out a back window.
The three regroup at a barn outside of town, where they nurse Munny back to health.

Three days later, they ambush a group of cowboys and kill Bunting.
Logan and Munny no longer have much stomach for murder.
Logan decides to return home while Munny and the Kid head to the cowboys' ranch, where the Kid ambushes Quick Mike in an outhouse and kills him.
After they escape, a distraught Kid confesses he had never killed anyone before.
He renounces life as a gunfighter.

When Little Sue meets the two men to give them the reward, they learn that Logan was captured by Little Bill's men and tortured to death.
He revealed the names of his two accomplices.
The Kid heads back to Kansas to deliver the reward money to Munny and Logan's families.
Munny drinks a little whisky from Ned's bottle and heads into town to take revenge on Bill.

That night, Logan's corpse is displayed in a coffin outside the saloon.
Inside, Little Bill has assembled a posse to pursue Munny and the Kid.
Munny walks in alone and kills Skinny Dubois, the saloon owner and pimp.
After some tense dialogue, a gunfight ensues, leaving Bill wounded and several of his deputies dead.
Munny orders everyone out before stopping Little Bill from reaching for his pistol.
Bill curses Munny before the latter finishes him with a final gunshot.
Munny threatens the townsfolk before finally leaving town, warning that he will return if Logan is not buried properly or if any prostitutes are further harmed.

A brief epilogue states that Munny was rumored to have moved to San Francisco, where he prospered in dry goods.","[STR_SENT] A group of prostitutes in Big Whiskey, Wyoming, led by Strawberry Alice, offer a $1,000 reward to whoever can kill Quick Mike and ""Davey-Boy"" Bunting, two cowboys who disfigured Delilah Fitzgerald, one of their own.

One Eight Seven,"Trevor Garfield is an African American high school science teacher at Roosevelt Whitney High School, a high school in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.
Dennis Broadway, a gangster student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him, writing the number 187 (the police code for homicide) on every page of one of Garfield's textbooks.
The administration ignores the threat, and Dennis ambushes Garfield in the hallway, stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a shiv.

Fifteen months after surviving from the ordeal, Garfield, now a substitute teacher, has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, but the trouble starts again when he becomes a substitute to a rowdy, unruly class of rejects, including a Chicano tag crew by the name of ""Kappin' Off Suckers"" (K.O.S.).
Their leader, Benito ""Benny"" Chacón, a menacing felon attending high school as a condition of probation, makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect between them.

The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats.
Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but which is stymied by Garfield's diffident and destabilizing behavior, likely arising from post-traumatic stress disorder and his confrontations with the K.O.S.. Garfield's past also garners him the unwanted admiration of Dave Childress, a burned-out, alcoholic history teacher who carries and keeps guns at the school.

After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood, he inexplicably disappears, and Benny's severely unstable tag partner, César, takes over as leader and class antagonist.
The conflict between Garfield and the K.O.S.
escalates with the killing of Jack, Ellen's dog.
César, after spraying cartoon graffiti depicting a dog with a ""dead"" face, is shot with a syringe filled with morphine attached to the end of an arrow.
He passes out, and wakes up to find one of his fingers cut off.
César later recovers the finger and it is reattached, though the letters ""R U DUN"" (""are you done?"")
have been tattooed onto it as a warning.

A student Garfield has tutored, a Chicana by the name of Rita Martínez, faces continuing abuse from both the K.O.S.
and Childress, and drops out.
The school administration is hopelessly mired in bureaucracy and unable to intervene.
After Benny is found dead in the Los Angeles River, apparently of a drug overdose, it becomes clear that Garfield has taken justice into his own hands, playing by the rules of the street in an intense contest with César and the K.O.S.

The K.O.S.
plan to murder Garfield after they accuse him of killing Benny and amputating César's finger.
The conflict comes to a head at Garfield's house, as the gang forces Garfield into a contest of Russian roulette with César (who gets the idea from watching The Deer Hunter).
The latter's resolve is finally shaken, as Garfield gets through to him about the lost-cause lifestyle he has led, saying ""Your whole way of life is bullshit.
Macho is bullshit."".
Hesitating at his turn, César watches as Garfield, offering to take his turn for him, takes the revolver and shoots himself in the head.
Driven by his personal sense of honor and ignoring the protests of his horrified friends, César insists on taking his rightful turn and ends up killing himself in the same manner as his teacher.

Later on graduation day, Rita, who returns and completes her studies along with former K.O.S.
member Stevie, offers a tribute to Garfield by reading an essay about him at commencement.
The essay incorporates the theme of the Pyrrhic victory, which Garfield had once explained to her in a tutoring session.
The film ends on a somber note as Ellen, presumably disheartened at the incident, appears to leave the school (she throws her teaching certificate into a garbage bin).","[STR_SENT] Trevor Garfield is an African American high school science teacher at Roosevelt Whitney High School, a high school in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.

The Shining (film),"Jack Torrance arrives at the Overlook Hotel to interview for the position of winter caretaker, with the aim of using the hotel's solitude to work on his writing.
The hotel itself is built on the site of a Native American burial ground and becomes completely snowed in during the long winters.
Manager Stuart Ullman warns him that a previous caretaker developed cabin fever and killed his family and himself.
Jack's son, Danny, appears to have ESP and has had a terrifying premonition about the hotel.
Jack's wife, Wendy, tells a visiting doctor that Danny has an imaginary friend named Tony, and that Jack has given up drinking because he had hurt Danny's arm following a binge.

The family arrives at the hotel on closing day and is given a tour.
The African-American chef Dick Hallorann surprises Danny by telepathically offering him ice cream.
He explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared this telepathic ability, which he calls ""shining"".
Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly Room 237.
Hallorann tells Danny that the hotel itself has a ""shine"" to it along with many memories, not all of which are good.
He also tells Danny to stay out of Room 237.

A month passes; while Jack's writing project goes nowhere, Danny and Wendy explore the hotel's hedge maze.
Wendy becomes concerned about the phone lines being out due to the heavy snowfall and Danny has more frightening visions.
Jack, increasingly frustrated, starts acting strangely and becomes prone to violent outbursts.

Danny's curiosity about Room 237 gets the better of him when he sees the room's door open.
Later, Wendy finds Jack, asleep at his typewriter, screaming while in the midst of a horrifying nightmare.
After she awakens him, he says he dreamed that he had killed her and Danny.
Danny then shows up with a bruise on his neck and visibly traumatized, causing Wendy to accuse Jack of abusing Danny.
Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room where he meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd.
Lloyd serves him bourbon on the rocks while Jack complains to him about his marriage.

Wendy later tells Jack that Danny told her that a ""crazy woman in one of the rooms"" tried to strangle him.
Jack investigates Room 237, where he encounters the ghost of a dead woman, but tells Wendy he saw nothing.
Wendy and Jack argue about whether Danny should be removed from the hotel and a furious Jack returns to the Gold Room, now filled with ghosts having a costume party.
Here, he meets the ghost of the previous caretaker, Grady, who tells Jack that he must ""correct"" his wife and child, and that Danny has reached out to Hallorann somehow.

Meanwhile, in Florida, Hallorann has a premonition that something is wrong at the hotel and takes a flight back to Colorado to investigate.
Danny starts calling out ""redrum"" frantically and goes into a trance, now referring to himself as ""Tony"".

While searching for Jack, Wendy discovers his typewriter; he has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating ""all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" in different layouts.
She is confronted by Jack, who threatens her before she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat.
She manages to drag him into the kitchen and lock him in the pantry, but this does not solve her larger problem; she and Danny are trapped at the hotel since Jack has sabotaged the hotel's two-way radio and snowcat.
Later, Jack converses through the pantry door with Grady, who then unlocks the door, releasing him.

Danny writes ""REDЯUM"" in lipstick on the bathroom door.
When Wendy sees this in the bedroom mirror, the letters spell out ""MURDƎЯ"".
Jack begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters with a fire axe.
Wendy frantically sends Danny out through the bathroom window, but it will not open sufficiently for her to fit through it herself.
Jack then starts chopping through the bathroom door as Wendy screams in horror.
He leers through the hole he has made, shouting ""Here's Johnny!
"", but backs off after Wendy slashes his hand with a butcher knife.

Hearing the engine of the snowcat Hallorann has borrowed to get up the mountain, Jack leaves the room.
He kills Hallorann in the lobby and pursues Danny into the hedge maze.
Wendy runs through the hotel looking for Danny, encountering several ghosts and a huge cascade of blood from an elevator.
Meanwhile, Danny walks backwards in his own tracks and leaps behind a corner, covering his tracks with snow to mislead Jack, who is following his footprints.
Wendy and Danny escape in Hallorann's snowcat, while Jack freezes to death in the hedge maze.

While McClane changes clothes, the party is disrupted by the arrival of Hans Gruber and his heavily armed group: Karl, Franco, Tony, Theo, Alexander, Marco, Kristoff, Eddie, Uli, Heinrich, Fritz, and James.
The group seize the tower and secure those inside as hostages except for McClane, who manages to slip away armed only with a Beretta 92 service pistol.

Gruber singles out Nakatomi executive Joseph Takagi claiming he intends to teach the Corporation a lesson for its greed.
Away from the other hostages, Gruber interrogates Takagi for the code to the building's vault as McClane secretly observes.
Gruber admits that they are using terrorism as a distraction while they attempt to steal $640 million in bearer bonds in the vault.
Takagi refuses to cooperate and is executed by Gruber.

Gruber sends Heinrich and Marco to stop McClane, but McClane manages to kill both.
Powell, finding nothing strange about the building, attempts to leave, but McClane drops Marco's corpse onto Powell's car, alerting the LAPD who surround the building.
McClane takes Heinrich's bag containing C-4 explosives and detonators.

A SWAT team assaults the building with an unarmed M8 Greyhound armored car but the attack is anticipated, and James and Alexander destroy the car and massacre the SWAT team with rockets.

Deputy Chief Dwayne T. Robinson tells McClane to stay out of this, but only ends up getting punned at by McClane.
Holly's coworker Harry Ellis attempts to mediate between Hans and McClane for the return of the detonators.
McClane refuses to return them, causing Gruber to execute Ellis.
While checking the explosives attached to the roof, Gruber is confronted by McClane.
Gruber passes himself off as an escaped hostage and is given a gun by McClane.
Gruber attempts to shoot McClane but finds that the gun is unloaded.
Before McClane can act, Karl, Franco, and Fritz arrive.
McClane kills Fritz and Franco, but is forced to flee, leaving the detonators behind.

FBI agents arrive and take command of the police situation outside, ordering the building's power be shut off.
The power loss disables the vault's final lock as Gruber had anticipated.
Gruber demands that a helicopter arrive on the roof for transport—his intention is to detonate the explosives on the roof to kill the hostages and to fake the deaths of his men and himself.
Karl finds McClane and the two fight.
Meanwhile Gruber views a news report by Richard Thornburg that features McClane's children, causing Gruber to realize that McClane is Holly's husband.

Arbitrage (film),"Sixty-year-old magnate Robert Miller manages a hedge fund with his daughter Brooke (Brit Marling) and is about to sell it for a handsome profit.
However, unbeknownst to his daughter and most of his other employees, he has cooked his company's books in order to cover an investment loss and avoid being arrested for fraud.
One night, while driving with his mistress Julie Cote (Laetitia Casta), he begins to doze off and crashes; Julie is killed.
An injured Miller leaves the scene and decides to cover up his involvement to prevent the public, his wife Ellen (Susan Sarandon), and the prospective buyer James Mayfield (Graydon Carter) from discovering the truth.

Miller calls Jimmy Grant (Nate Parker), a twenty-three-year-old man from Harlem with a criminal record whom he helped get off the street in the past, and whose father had been Miller's driver for many years.
After being driven home by Grant, Miller drags his injured body into bed at 4:30 am, arousing suspicion in his wife.
The next day, he is questioned by police detective Bryer (Tim Roth).
Bryer is keen on arresting Miller for manslaughter and begins to put the pieces together.
Brooke discovers the financial irregularities, realizes that she could be implicated and confronts her father.

Jimmy is arrested and placed before a grand jury but still refuses to admit to helping Miller.
Miller once again contemplates turning himself in.
Even though Jimmy is about to go to prison, Miller tells Jimmy that investors are depending on him and that waiting for the sale to close before coming forward would serve the greater good.
Eventually the sale is closed but Miller finds a way to avoid being charged.
He proves that Detective Bryer fabricated evidence.
The case against Jimmy is dismissed and the detective is ordered not to go near him.
Miller's wife tries to blackmail him with a separation agreement getting rid of his wealth.
When Robert Miller refuses to sign, his wife says that she will tell the police that he got into bed at 4:30 am on the night of the accident, bruised and bleeding.

In the final scene, Miller addresses a banquet honoring him for his successful business, with his wife at his side and his daughter introducing him to the audience but their false embrace on the stage signifies that he has lost the respect and admiration of his daughter.
It is kept deliberately ambiguous whether he gave in to his wife's blackmail or she had backed off; in any case, his financial and personal misdeeds were clearly kept out of the public gaze.

Moon (film),"Sam Bell nears the end of a three-year work contract as the sole resident at Lunar Industries' largely automated lunar mining base ""Sarang"".
Sam oversees automated harvesters and launches canisters bound for Earth, containing the helium-3 they have extracted.
Chronic communication problems limit him to occasional recorded messages to his wife Tess, who was pregnant with their daughter Eve when he left.
His only companion is an artificial intelligence named GERTY, who assists with the base's automation.

Two weeks before he is to return to Earth, Sam suffers from hallucinations of a teenage girl.
One such image distracts him while he is out recovering a helium-3 canister from a harvester, causing him to crash his rover into the harvester.
Rapidly losing air, Sam puts on his helmet, but loses consciousness.

Sam awakes in the base infirmary with no memory of the accident.
He overhears GERTY receiving instructions from Lunar Industries not to let him outside the base and to wait for the arrival of rescue team ""Eliza"".
His suspicions aroused, he manufactures a fake problem to force GERTY to let him outside.
He travels to the crashed rover, where he finds an older Sam Bell, unconscious.

He brings Old Sam back to the base and tends to his injuries.
The two Sams start to wonder if one is a clone of the other.
After a heated argument and physical altercation, they together coerce GERTY into revealing that they are both clones of the original Sam Bell.
GERTY activated New Sam after the rover crash and implanted the memories of the original Sam Bell.

The two Sams begin searching the base, finding live communications jammed by transmitters located beyond the outermost perimeter of the base.
They also discover that four previous clones all started to physically deteriorate three years after awakening.
Told they would hibernate briefly for the journey home, they were actually incinerated after being put to sleep.

The two newest clones also find many more unconscious doubles in a secret hidden vault below the main level.
Old Sam drives past the interference radius in a second rover and calls Tess on Earth.
However, he instead makes contact with Eve, now 15 years old, who says Tess died ""some years ago"".
He hangs up when he hears her father, original Sam, talking in the background and coming toward the screen.

The two Sams realize that the incoming Eliza ""rescue"" team will kill them both if they are found together.
New Sam suggests sending the other to Earth in one of the helium-3 transports, but Old Sam, already badly deteriorated, knows that he will not live much longer.
He suggests New Sam leave instead, and alert the public to Lunar Industries' unethical practices.
Old Sam plans to die by the crashed rover so Lunar Industries will not suspect anything until it is too late.

New Sam orders GERTY to revive a seventh clone to greet the rescuers, then programs a harvester to crash and wreck a jamming antenna, thereby enabling live communications with Earth.
On the advice of GERTY—and to prevent the ELIZA team from discovering their plan by examining its memory archives—New Sam then reboots GERTY, erasing its records of the event.
Old Sam, back in the crippled rover, remains conscious long enough to watch the launch of the ship carrying New Sam to Earth.

As the credits roll, the helium transport is depicted entering Earth's upper atmosphere, while news reports describe how ""a Sam Bell clone's"" testimony on Lunar Industries' activities has stirred up an enormous controversy, with the company's shares dipping by a significant margin.","[STR_SENT] Sam Bell nears the end of a three-year work contract as the sole resident at Lunar Industries' largely automated lunar mining base ""Sarang"".

[END_SENT] [STR_SENT] They also discover that four previous clones all started to physically deteriorate three years after awakening. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Told they would hibernate briefly for the journey home, they were actually incinerated after being put to sleep. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The two newest clones also find many more unconscious doubles in a secret hidden vault below the main level. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Old Sam drives past the interference radius in a second rover and calls Tess on Earth. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] However, he instead makes contact with Eve, now 15 years old, who says Tess died ""some years ago"". [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] He hangs up when he hears her father, original Sam, talking in the background and coming toward the screen. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] The two Sams realize that the incoming Eliza ""rescue"" team will kill them both if they are found together. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] New Sam suggests sending the other to Earth in one of the helium-3 transports, but Old Sam, already badly deteriorated, knows that he will not live much longer. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] He suggests New Sam leave instead, and alert the public to Lunar Industries' unethical practices. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Old Sam plans to die by the crashed rover so Lunar Industries will not suspect anything until it is too late. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] New Sam orders GERTY to revive a seventh clone to greet the rescuers, then programs a harvester to crash and wreck a jamming antenna, thereby enabling live communications with Earth. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] On the advice of GERTY—and to prevent the ELIZA team from discovering their plan by examining its memory archives—New Sam then reboots GERTY, erasing its records of the event. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] Old Sam, back in the crippled rover, remains conscious long enough to watch the launch of the ship carrying New Sam to Earth. [END_SENT] [STR_SENT] As the credits roll, the helium transport is depicted entering Earth's upper atmosphere, while news reports describe how ""a Sam Bell clone's"" testimony on Lunar Industries' activities has stirred up an enormous controversy, with the company's shares dipping by a significant margin.
